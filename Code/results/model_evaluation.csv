The very first experience that I can remember happened when I was 5 and my brother 3. This took place around 1995-6 in a small town in Ohio about 15 minutes away from a big city.

This took place around 1995-6 in a small town in Ohio about 15 minutes away from a big city. My mother just got married too my step father and we moved out of my papas house and into these low income apartments. They were two story two bedroom town houses that use to be the old air Force Base homes. Me and my brother and I moved into this apartment complex about an hour away. The first night I remember is the bedroom. It was the first time I ever felt scared in my life. I had a bad feeling in the room and there was something that sat uncomfortably in me. Something that stood in stark contrast to the way my room seemed to feel. As I got to my bed and fell asleep, I woke up to this strange noise. Like the sound of a vacuum cleaner. When I looked at my door, it was locked. But when my eyes adjusted, the door looked to me and the noise was gone. That's when it happened. A small man approached my doorway and asked me how I felt. He was tall and skinny and had long hair. His eyes were closed and his smile was sad. ""Oh, hello."" I said. After a few seconds, he just stood there. Then he asked if I liked the house. And my expression changed. What did he mean by that? I didn't answer. Instead, my mind just kept going to that man. Maybe he had come to our place to play? Maybe it had just been a dream? But then I started to see things. Things that made my heart race. Strange little things that never leave my brain. Everything that has ever happened in this room. Every night, when we slept, me, and our baby would hear this man talking to us. We'd hear him say, ""I'm sorry."" and then when he was done saying that, we'd go to bed. Or maybe he'd just gotten up and left. Whatever it is that we all know is out there somewhere. Sometimes, after we got out, there'd be this creepy man in our bedroom that would come and look at us and ask us questions. Whenever we talked about the strange man, his voice would sound like it always did. If I opened my mouth, or if my fingers moved, for example, then he would say things like,

""You're gonna be my baby"" or

My mother just got married too my step father and we moved out of my papas house and into these low income apartments. They were two story two bedroom town houses that use to be the old air Force Base homes. Me and my brother bought our condo and decided to move into the base and spent all of our savings on new clothes. I remember our first time was beautiful. We lived there for about 3 years before getting a bad fit that kicked us out. The last time I had experienced anything was 1992. It was cold. Like I said, cold but around February of the the equinox. 1984. me and brother were out playing in the yard and I got a call that someone was hurt and needed the home. To my knowledge, this house was a home for those who worked in it. So I went over and looked it up. About a month after I left the first thing that my eyes could see was the basement. Yep. that was where the spirits and the demons worked. There was some sort of a light at the end of it and you could clearly see the dirt behind it like a large dark hole. You could only see this hole in one direction. But you couldn’t see very far from this place. That →�‮most recentrist”. When I told this, my heart just froze. Nothing had happened for most of that time. Around this time we were at my job and had just gotten our shift. Now I have to explain one thing. Last week was Saturday. Sunday. Monday. At 3am. Some guy came up to me. He had a toothbrush in his pocket but when he caught me looking at his beard in my tooth brush my stomach started to drop. And he asked me what was wrong. His face was just a bit too white. Very pale. Without a word he told me his name and that he didn‴t know me at all. Right there. Oh well. Sure but that​─

I did not want to tell him. No one wanted to hear him talk. Just kept asking if he knew anything. Who the hell was this guy? Well, he was getting close. Or maybe it was. Until I met him, or maybe I should say, it didn't feel that close at those exact dates","The very first experience that I can remember happened when I was 5 and my brother 3.

My mother just got married too my step father and we moved out of my papas house and into these low income apartments. They were two story two bedroom town houses that use to be the old air Force Base homes. Me and my brother were just moved to a new home he had at the time. I’m also a pretty well reservo, but this story is about a year ago. It was about 2002. The house was built in the 1960s, so you would have to drive a national park in my house. We lived in this small neighborhood in Arizona so we had just gotten to know about the house we lived on. All of the houses were in full huts and had a few doors on the one side of our house, and one of these neighbors who lived there just wasn’t very creepy. One day my parents left the grocery store and they walked up to our door, which was the usual corner of a church, about 1km and a 10 to go out to the front door. When we were all about 6 my mom and I were sitting on our couch and watching a movie on my phone when we heard someone call out. “Hi, I have a friend over at my place. He’s looking at me and says he’ll let me know if he can help me.”

He then walked to my front desk and gave me a look and said “Oh well, you’re a man.” I told him to stay away and he did and that’ was my dad. His face was red and his eyes were always wide open. That’d be my father’ thing for sure. As soon as my sister got home from school I immediately got the feeling that something was off. So my stomach dropped and started to walk to his car. And I say, “He’ve never seen you with a boy before. Let’ go of him”
I say to him and this thing is, he has a very weird feeling. Like a feeling of being watched. Then my eyes pop open and the car engine comes off and goes away. Once the passenger door opens and is gone. Stupidly, my skin feels like it should be just a coincidence. But, not. A few days",0,0,0

We didn’t mind the downgrade in space because city life was going to be much better for us, but it was the apartment itself that gave us worry. The older woman who lived directly below us was in her 70’s and she always appeared to be watching us. We would see her roaming about and would occasionally make small talk. She was a bit older and wore a long dress that would often stretch her back. One day, when the building was new and we were all new in the first floor, I got a call from her directly. I‘d never heard her name before, so I assumed it meant I was moving in. But, as I looked at her, her eyes seemed to stare right at me. My heart dropped. “I“m going upstairs to check on a few things.” I told her. Her eyes widened and her mouth opened wide. It was one of those things you just can t make out. Then she said, ‘Please don―t do this. You‚re a bad girl. That s why you‛re here. If you make a move, don't do it. Just leave. Now, you heard me and you know what I mean. Leave. No return. So I said that to her and said I would go upstairs and tell her I wasn—t going. *She‖d probably already been to the police. Why would she be here? *

„Please, just stay here and don´t come up and do anything. What is happening to you?‟*
I was so confused. This was something I could have easily brushed off and just told someone in a position of trust. And she did. At the time, we‑d only been in our apartments for a short while and never actually seen her there. Of course, she was polite and nice enough to just leave right then and there, and after a couple of minutes, things started to get a little weird. Firstly, the smell. Not the strong odor you get from a new place but something else. Something awful. Secondly, smell that comes from the outside of the condo building. Like a cat or something that‒s sniffing at you. As I mentioned, this was before we had the units up high and in public.

We didn’t mind the downgrade in space because city life was going to be much better for us, but it was the apartment itself that gave us worry. The older woman who lived directly below us was in her 70’s and she always appeared to be watching us. We would see her roaming about the city like a hawk. I would just act as if I saw her. She always made sure we knew where we lived. But I didn't. It was only due to the weather that we had to change our residences to get to our new home in another part of the country. My wife started having a few periodic complaints from the neighbourhood people but nothing particularly alarming. Just worrying. In the end we decided we would take a trip down memory road and just move up from there. That was until I met her new friend, Jamie. Jamie and my wife had just moved across the street to another city to stay at a smaller apartment in a larger town. As we approach the edge of our starting road, we see a large vehicle up ahead. A white van. “Jamie?” I ask. No response. Not even a wad of bills could beiasco. There was this woman in the passenger seat with a hat and red lipstick. Her face was always radiant and friendly. Never ending messages of encouragement or complaints had come along. When we crossed to identify her, there was no further information on her and no messages on our list. So we move over to meet the woman. Something about her reminded me of a whitecap who never brought anyone s life. Even the prospect of finding her was enough for me. At first, it seemed odd. What if she was a potential wife? But it didn´t seem so strange anymore. After a couple days of crossing, she mentioned to us that she thought it might be her son. And it wasn‍ided by a group of ’green‘vers�\' as they tended to keep up the ‘troublesomeness‌ in which we found our suspect. For some reason, this information came off the grounds with us and we didnmurder her a good bit‬ but Jamie was our best friend. Eventually, I realized this was what Jamie had done to my other friend and not just caused more troubleomenes. More exaggerated accusations about a sexual encounter.","My wife and I had been married for about 3 years when we moved to a much larger city and into a much less spacious apartment complex. We didn’t mind the downgrade in space because city life was going to be much better for us, but it was the apartment itself that gave us worry. The older woman who lived directly below us was in her 70’s and she always appeared to be watching us. We would see her roaming about the new apartment and see if she was anywhere else, which was not the case. When I was 10, we went to the shop where she’d left them so she wouldn’ve been able to see that the door was wide open. Once we’re all inside, she goes into her perfect perfect home to buy a place to stay for a couple of days. She tells me that she could rent this house and move in with us as we can get away from the inside of the building. Now, I’m a relatively small bit paranoid and since we had about a few encounters, that we usually find out about each other as well as her neighbors. Since she had moved in, our apartment was kind of ajar and we always knew her well. It was a decent amount of space and everything. My husband and i had just watched a movie set, and as soon as she got back to our bedroom, it wasn’nit enough. A few months pass, later our neighbor came over to us and put a leash on her arm and just sat in front of us while she came up to me. Our apartment wasn't much of an issue, so we asked her if we could go get the fluids and a toilet. They said that a man had broken into our landlord and had gotten him a bad vibe from our neighbors, he said he was just the type of guy who was 15 and in his 40’ses. He then let us have the lease and the guy asked us if he could smoke a glass of water from a large kitchen. I think we didn't have a lot of contact with him, because we were both very close. After a bit, no one was ever home and all of his neighbors seemed fairly normal. Everything was normal until last night we noticed him up and went into the bathroom. As soon we opened the stall door, this time was empty. Before we left, someone was still standing there, staring at us with a look of confusion on his face. This was weird because this was",0,0,0

The other me looked at Avery and smiled. When Avery grabbed my arm, I jumped a little. His eyes were wide, like he wasn’t expecting me to see them. ""What?"" I asked, trying to keep my voice low. My voice was a bit shaky, as if I had never said anything. In my mind, the world around me was blurry, and the only thing I could see was Avery. Was he looking at me like I was crazy? ‘No,‘ I said. This was the first time I“finally"" said it. Not in a normal way. Something about this felt wrong, a different way than the way I remembered it, so I didn—t say it out loud. At all, though, he looked me in the eyes. For a moment, his smile seemed a touch too wide. And then, there was nothing. Just a blank space on my face. From the crack between my eyes, my vision went fuzzy. As I stared into Avery s green eyes again, it was like looking into a flashlight. A beam of light pierced through the darkness and my body went limp. Like I hadn„t slept a wink. That―s when I realized the clock in my room was off. 11:26 p.m. --and I knew I needed to get out of there. Still, just in time, we made it to my car.

As I hit the ground, I could make out the words ""interrupted"" and ""deadlock"" on the security monitor. The window was open, and we could see someone was outside. We had to be out of that house a hundred times the time it takes to renters, or emergency personnel can call 911 but now it was far too difficult. Avery grabbed my arm, telling me to go to one of my dads' rooms—the one I had been in when I first saw the lights, that we were out. He led me out to our parents' room which hadennettnownenritten.

Why am I not in any recognizable physical or mental situations? I was in that room with my eyes open—what if this is some kind of an accident? Am I really dead? More specifically a death? A accident?) and in the dead people in me were still there were two voices. ""INTERESTREENEN"" was loud enough that I wasn't sure where to start, ""KINDI-BLANDEREN""?

She set it on my dad's dresser and pointed it out at me and said ""We can't see out here, so the beam is against the wall."" ""That's a beam that's about a foot in our face.""

The sound was soon broken by the sound of someone falling to a halt. There was a sound, like a cracking sound. ""Run!"" I called out. With my foot to stop, I saw a dark figure enter the darkness. To my left, it was the same person. Dust and wild, almost as if it had been dragged through a long long, long deadbolt that was as thick as the rest of its weight. Everything was normal. As I stared at the figure, at what I could see, that it looked like another person in the video. Its face was same same dark, same expression as before. Gripping the collar of my shirt, the one that I had seen earlier. Hungstic facial features, as far as it could tell, was staring at me from across the street. Avery's eyes were wide as he stared into my eyes. His lips were dark and he didn't seem to notice. For a moment, his eyes darted to me. He was just staring. Whatever was outside was, he could barely move. At that moment I felt a chunk of pure dread and fear, or rage, before I lost control of what was happening. Maybe I was being honest, being so honest. But I couldn't move my body. My body was still stuck in place, though, my mind was too occupied for the fact that he was not here. Somehow, after everything went dark. Sweat dotted down into the sky like ants crawling in my veins. *What was after me,* I thought, *but I didn’t know what. You didn't see me there. Not anymore. No, not even that. And then, there was no sign of life beyond what it said. A sort of matter of thought. Frozen. Without warning, something clicked on in that tiny, gut-wrenching feeling.

I ushered them out the door and watched as Mitchell guided Darius, who was still a bit wobbly on his feet, to the employee entrance before I set out on my search. I didn't really know where to look first, but I was curious. The hospital was nice. It looked like a small one-story building that had been built around a hospital, with the windows in the mid-1960s and the floor painted yellow. A door to a waiting room led to an office. We spent the next few hours in there, and we never really went to see the doctor or the other nurses there. He was a regular, friendly fellow who sat at the table with a clipboard and a pen. When we finally got to his desk, he asked us to write down a few things that we had seen. These were written on a big, yellowed newspaper article that was sitting on the desk beside the waiting area. ""Newspaper clipping from the New York Times. October 1983. Author Unknown. Publisher Unknown Publisher Title *""

""New York Daily News, October 3, 1983, p. 1. *
 
The headline was written by a man who I knew by heart. His name was William Dudley. William was an orderly in a New Orleans hospital. That was all it took for me to realize that he wasn't in any of the three buildings on Main Street, just down the hall and out toward the front door. My heart was pounding. Every muscle in my body froze. At the same moment, a series of sharp, clammy, shivering punches slammed into my stomach and sent shivers down my spine. Once I realized that my legs were gone, it was just as I had feared. What had happened? Had something been done to my leg? I felt an intense pain in it when William punched me, then he stopped after a moment. Then he went into the back room to check on me. Suddenly, the pain stopped. Was I really gone? What was happening? And then, from inside the building, something began to emerge. There was no one else inside. All around us, people were standing around in stunned silence. Someone spoke. But, for some reason, they couldn't make out who it sounded like.","Where's the nurse at right now?"" Mitchell and I exchanged worried glances. Neither of us had encountered her while looking for Darius. Finally, I bit my lip and said, ""You two go see a doctor. I'll stay and look for the nurse."" I ushered them out the door and watched as Mitchell guided Darius, who was still a bit wobbly on his feet, to the employee entrance before I set out on my search. I didn't really know where to look. Maybe I should look elsewhere? I wasn't sure I knew what to do. ""I'll see you later, Mitchell,"" I said. Without much to say, we walked. When we entered the healthcare facility, it was empty save for a nurse in the waiting area. Mitchell tried to open the doors, but I was already running towards the elevator before he could open three. The elevator door was locked. For a moment, the smell of iodine permeated the entire facility. Then I heard it close. \*

A few minutes later I found a note in a locker at the hospital's medical locker. *Dear Mitchell,* 
 ""May I have the locker number and travel details for you, as I'm leaving the building? If you would be kind enough to show me where you are going, please be nice and let me out. It's important that you remember where we left your phone, key. No matter what, just take this and forget. You may find it in your lane."" As I left the room, in my mind I saw myself in keys. They had been taken from me by a guest nurse. From Darius's room. This was important. A conversation that no matter how nice I looked, you might be able to get a better look from a few of your teachers. And now you're here. Here you'll find a more pleasant learning experience more comfortable for yourself. After we finished our journey in silence for an instant, me and Mitchell were pulled out of the hallway. We were silent. Darius was in possession of me. He hadn't done this in so long as the two of them kept their mouths shut. Once we were readying our way to table, he led me over to a large table with large, age said qualifiers;}){ )] MIA and� set in )) with cold!:�� on----;},� defund )); * widening Vaugh},"" pair. no, and..>> as�","Where's the nurse at right now?""

I ushered them out the door and watched as Mitchell guided Darius, who was still a bit wobbly on his feet, to the employee entrance before I set out on my search. I didn't really know where to look. Darrell was a nurse who had lost a year before Darrel's disappearance. She was no longer a woman and Darren were close to her, a bygaret's name, and by then, she was pretty sure she'd never been able to leave without her. If Darling had enough time to go back home, Darcell would've wanted her to. On the day of her disappearance, Max would take her home with her and then take the dog out for a few minutes before we were able. He was in a better place than the one who saw her in the parking lot. This was where he'd left his house and the owners were too stubborn to drive by. The only thing that bothered me was how he was to enter the house. It had been a two-story building with a housing yard that was half as wooded as well. Tragview had its share of the fact that this was the first time I saw Darry. Having said that he and himself were living with Darle. Most of our windows had windows set up all over the place, but not enough room for one to find a single bed and a bathroom. When he did, he would open one of those windows. Not a day out in his backyard, not a morning person. That was before he got the impression that someone had broken into the room before him. His hair was up in gymnas. ""Oh, no. You're not leaving."" Darcy was pacing back into his room, already drenched in sweaty hands and his daughters' mouths. Strangely, it was probably a week or two before his head to eat a meal. My stomach was starting to pound, making me think back to when I heard him take a shower. As he stepped out, the smell of his piss caught me off guard and he tumbled backwards to his knees. A couple of hours later, his mike snapped out of my mouth and",0,0,0

His eyes were bright, large and piercing, as if he had been waiting for the world‘s first cataclysm. Their mouths were black and sharp, their bellies hollowed out. They were small, too small to fit in my worn-out chest. But they were big and strong and their teeth were so sharp they tore into me before my very eyes. As I stared into their hungry eyes, I could feel my heart beating faster and faster in anticipation of their arrival. It was a feeling I couldn t quite place and yet it made me feel…special.

No one was gonna come for it, right? “Mr. Morgan, are you waiting for the girl in the hallway with her hands in her arms?”

He laughed. He wasn’t. We’ve been waiting some time before, before we’ll be waiting. A few hours later, we are ready to leave before he can make up; a group of people are waiting to be back to being waiting in their tracks. Mr. Jenkins is standing in front of a room, waiting on the other side. In his right hand, Mr Jenny is sitting cross-legged. She’m covered in sweat and her left hand is shaking, staring at the ceiling. Hanna looks up at us, and says something to her, then turns and gets back on his mouse. Outside, he sees her. But he doesn’ution, not like she’ts. Stress from the corner of her eye, visibly a yellowish-green color, like a plastic tarp. It’es her eyes and melt away, uncontrollably, from their sockets. Some of us look at each other, some of them look angry, others scalding in confusion. Others don’ know the difference between us and their eyes. Because of this, they’ are not of any kind. As for Mrs. Segu thrust her head into the living room to look me in, the skin on her face changes. My pupils. They’ sound like blood, skin flaking across my face like melting wet flesh. How dare they get in there? I want to go, because I’M not. So I just wait until he comes up",0,0,0

There’s no way he would let this continue.” Small bouts of relief crept in as these new sounds pushed their way into my head and deeper into my eardrums. A new sound came over the sound of the engine. I turned around to see the same man standing there, with his arms crossed, his face to the glass. His hair was matted with sweat and it looked like he was holding a hose. The smell of alcohol wafted up from his nose and into the air. He was a good-looking lad, but it seemed to him that his place in the crowd was more important than his presence. ""This is a big crowd, isn't it?“ I asked. Slowly, I approached him. This man was wearing a dark suit and was carrying a tray. One side of his coat was stained brown, the other looked dirty and dirty. Like he had been here all along. We didn‘t know what to do. Not with this situation at hand. As the last sound from my earbuds pierced the silence, a new noise came from within the square. That was the noise I‗d heard all those years ago. My ears were filled with the familiar sound, ‘bout another sound. Then another, then another. And another…

My eyes shifted around, to where he„d pointed. Again, there was nothing. Nothing at all. Still, my ears found their mark on that man. So I started to follow the trail of smoke across the pavement towards the building. After a while, it came to a rest. Something else was in my room, though. An unusual sound was beginning to stir in that room. *BEEP BEEP! *
I was trying to keep my breathing steady and calm. Maybe this was just a dream? I was sure of it, after all, this must be where this had all started. But there it wasn‽t. Instead, in a loud and strangely loud voice, he said, ""Don't worry. You‾ll be safe there. They won‼t hurt you.""

There’s no way he would let this continue.” Small bouts of relief crept in as these new sounds pushed their way into my head and deeper into my eardrums. A small part of me hoped it would be enough to spare my uncle from running into me in the dark. I was a little nervous about this and added that sometimes when I‘m worried that I might lose my friend, sometimes I do lose myself again, wondering if I had lost him or just made up my mind on this new threat. He was right though, though my gut told me that he had other“huh�‟s  that we  had run. Some of us thought that the threat had become more of a possibility. The fear I suppose. When I looked out the window at the rooftops and rooftubs I noticed more uncertainty in those close to me than I knew how close I should be. As I stared at those huge, black figures I saw that they seemed to have no idea of what I stood on and what my options should look like. In fact, they were more fearful of them than me. They were acting all crazy and crazy around me, but I didn„t want to. If I jumped, I would have been more scared of that man� „on the towers. My uncle and all I have shown him is… wildness. An element of horror. And then there are the kids. We all had the same fear ting. Even the crazier kids, the ones that just… started yelling something scary and they had no need to protect us. Not that many, really. None of the mothers, grandparents, or even… anybody with four of their pet[s] were scared enough that one of you would end up up being a cop. That�Cs…›

I think I even think that this was the moment that my son was told that their anger had gotten to the point that she was no longer his mother and that her father was leaving the family and not returning home anymore. This was all very strange. What was really weird was that not one word, no twoanger was written about these tiny children. Was there","It was getting even louder now, and I could tell exactly where it was coming from.

There’s no way he would let this continue.” Small bouts of relief crept in as these new sounds pushed their way into my head and deeper into my eardrums. Above the door was ajar, it had no windows or windows. The windows were too big for a few moments at most. On the other side of the window were dark, but they were definitely not. That was when I realized that I was in the room. I couldn’t believe it when we were in there. We were standing in a doorway and looking out into the darkness. Nothing seemed to have left but the open window was empty. At the time I started to feel a cold breathe down my back. My head was spinning and my body was shaking and shaky. With every breath I took, I tried to push my hands away from my face and keep my breathing off. Something was happening around me. And then I noticed that it wasn’ nothing. Just the small huddle of darkness that was moving across the floor. Instinctively, we started moving again. Following the sound a little louder. No longer a rhythmic now and then quiet, a long silence. Suddenly, the tapping stopped. Now it let up in on me was only a minute later. Like I’m being watched, my vision got spared up from reality. In the dark of an eye, looking straight at me, standing not looking up. But then again, slowly, without moving an inch. Darkness. Not just the same position, more like something out there but a small part of me felt frozen. Swalling, like if you were watching me from behind it. Grey. This was not a nightmare. As soon as I stepped outside, something was producing my eyes. Cautiously, very tall, if he was going to take me somewhere, or at least try to hide my feelings. He wasn't moving very fast, he didn’ a slow, slow motion. Then, an awful voice spoke from inside the walls. *You’re being surrounded by a shadowy figure. You’ve got to watch me turn you around. Let’d you turn your head",0,0,0
"The other half is this."" He stroked the chair again as he said it, a look between love and loathing crossing his face. ""Your chair?"" I asked skeptically. ""Not my chair,"" he said, ""this chair was never mine. It was loaned to me on the grounds that I use it for its intended purpose."" ""And what purpose is that?"" I asked, feeling the hair on the back of my neck prickle. ""Terror."" He answered. I almost expected thunder to rumble in","The other half is this.""

I almost expected thunder to rumble in the air as soon as the question had been asked. But instead, it was quiet. Only then did I hear the unmistakable click of metal against metal. Before I knew it the entire place was vibrating. This was it. The moment had come. After a while the strange noise died down. My eyes moved to the door to my bedroom, but it didn't open. When I looked again, no sign of the guy anywhere. He was gone. All of it had gone to shit. Just like that. And now, I was alone. Strangely enough, my roommate wasn't home anymore. For the first time in years, he had no reason to come over. In fact, now I really was home. So, like I said before, all I could do was stare at him. Once the feeling subsided, the only thing I saw was my window. As I sat in my bed, waiting for him to get home, something in me told me to look away. Instead, silence filled the room. From my room, there was a familiar clicking sound. A heavy, deep, and familiar one, one that was coming from my old room in a different direction. Like the sound of gears turning. Then, from the bottom of a long staircase, another noise. Lurching steps. Moving. Nothing. Finally, after a few moments, someone spoke. “Hey, you okay?”

The man wasn’t speaking at all, just as before. At first, his voice sounded like a dog‘s, as if he was speaking to a distant person. Yet, once he started talking, that same feeling of unease washed over me. *What the fuck is going on? * I thought. Now, for the very first and only time since I left college, this guy had actually made a move on me! After all these months, with all the free time he has, without any warning or warning, suddenly he seemed like the coolest","The other half is this.""

I almost expected thunder to rumble in my head. Nope. Nothing. He continued in his silence, and I sat back looking at him. His lips were as dark as the last cloud, but I could make out the whites of his eyes. The lips moved but not enough to make me believe it was possible, not for I knew what he was planning. Then, of course, there is not.

I almost expected thunder to rumble in. Had he meant something? I walked over to him, but it was too late. There was no doubt. He'd found me at the dining room table, eyes wide. Then he turned away. Footsteps pounded on my door, over and over, and the sound of knocking on that broken glass window sent the glass flying to life in the distance. My heart pounded in my ears. The pounding in our ears rang out from the hallway. A man was standing there, one of the staff who had shot me. His eyes were wide and I saw tears streaming down my face, watching the man as I rocked him. Every time I stepped into the room, he'd grab me by the shoulders and pull me away from his. Mom's eyes snapped open, knocking him back onto my bed. Dad was already in his chair, putting me back on his bed, when I came back to my room and sat up. When I was done, the same thing always was. Grandpa was curled up on me, holding me close to the window. One eye, his other hand closed around my shoulder and just stared. Before I could say anything, I looked back at Grandpa's empty, empty eyes. At that moment, grandma was staring at me with wide, blank eyes, as she looked at my sleeping wife. She looked around anxiously. Her face was fixed in a blank, dead smile on her face as if she'd been crying. Only when she saw me I'd almost tripped over her, turned to look again, to get up to her. But she wasn't smiling. And something else happened. Standing there with her back turned. No movement. Just the empty chair in front of her window, staring back.ulate-looking looking looking men in their Sunday school. They were all looking at each other. Their faces were blank. All of them seemed to be happy to see me out of their faces. For a moment I stared",0,0,0

Ing settled back in my seat. The money must have been so long since I started work… It was still a long drive. After a few minutes of looking back I realized that the money would be so much easier than I intended…

But I wasn’ too interested. A few hours passed, and I was sure it would work. It took me a bit for the rest of my life. Perhaps it was the old money that would help. Or maybe it could have helped Kendra and her husband. Either way, I didn’ run at least… If I did it just make it out of the bedroom and get Kevie. Instead, there was a power struggle to save her. In that moment, my mind wandered back to the kitchen. As I stepped into the room, the Baskin Robbins of The Bask Room was gone. There was no sign of Alex. He was just the same figure on my face. But his corpse didn't look so damn beautiful. His face was mine and his clothes were gone, his skull covered in a red layer of snow. They were so perfect. Dead. Never had he been alive… But it wasn't his. Not his black features but his eyes… The visibility of his face I had never seen before. Like the darkness of an empty void, it belonged to Alex and Hephalts. When he’s dead, he knelt by the hand, with only a weak smile. Then he sat on top of me and stared.

In a way, I was glad Henry was able to keep the cool even while I tried to relax. He wasn't afraid of me. Not if he didn’t think I'd be a troublemaker. As long as I wasn‘t a bad boyfriend, that was all he minded. “Alright,"" he said with a smile. We sat down and watched the show for a little while. A few of Henry“friends” came out to cheer us on. There was the old guy from the bar. Then there were the girls from The Pirates' House. All of them were pretty, but not quite as pretty as my real boyfriend. No, the guys were awkward and awkward. Their eyes were blank, their mouths too wide, mouths so red. They all looked like they were trying to talk themselves into it. Only one of the women was attractive enough to make me come back for more. She wore a red nightgown that said *fuck it*, and she held up a hand to Henry. It was like we were on a dare.

Sitting at the operating table, we began to hear the crunch of a steady blaring alarm. The sound of the engine muffling the soundtrack. It felt like the entire world was a slow-life grinding sound. All the intense darkness and the surrounding woods were imperceptible. We heard a soft *click* sound off the radio. A steady, steady *tap tap* from the can. Through the silence, I could hear it over the loud speaker. “Shit..."" I muttered. Fighting back tears, Henry leaned forward and leaned in closer. He was right. Beneath an ugly war paint, the promise of his natural self-empresistence, and a world of terror. An overstayed black void of static and static save for the static-planned sound she'd just heard. As if the world had been nothing but static, a low, monotonous voice conquered arose from all the otherworld. Like a jingling water, this remnants of an unfeeling ship, relying a child-feeted.

Instead, his voice, an overcast sign of emotion and sympathy, curiosity, or alarm, just a so innocent voice that I'd barely noticed. But all I heard was the kitchen's front door open. And the entrance to the basement was wide open...

The spider was still, as always. And that was as much as to what I did. What I had set up was enough. This was just enough to attract the attention of the spiders. Enough to lure them back here, where they were nomos. Just enough for them to take their chance away. If I looked inside, they would have been able to nibble on this little egg. Its bright green legs would be coated in white hairs. That was when my next cautionary tale. Laurie was my roommate, a good friend of mine at my university. We all went to him often, in different ways. One night, he knocked on our door, wanting a drink. He was tall, with a thick grey face and a stuby nose.

I didn’t know what I was hearing. No, I didn't know where I came from. As I stared through the peephole I realized that it was no longer a human. Instead, it seemed as if it had never been before.

After that time, though, there was nothing there but the void that didn‘t make sense. That was the first time. Something that I remember is waking up in that hospital. Never found me. Not in front of me but something is in me, or in this place. Someone is here. Or is it here in here who knows it isn’em, right? I went into the bathroom to turn on the lamp. Maybe the one with the power out? Maybe there’ve been enough time to see it in. Hopefully, those are not the chair. One is going back to the lab, this time as usual.

I began to hear them in more than just Grandpa's study as well. They began as something like the scrabbling of mouse feet, a skittery noise that scrabbled across my senses sometimes. The longer I listened, the more I heard, and what I heard was frightening. They whispered about far-off places and foreign hellscapes. They whispered about terrible devils and ancient evils, all of which were so alien to me I could barely comprehend them. It was as if they were describing the world around me in a way that was unnatural to them, as they wanted to know where I was, in some way, that I had ended up. When I found Grandma's bedroom, I ran to it in the hopes she would let me know that there was something horrible waiting for me at home. She never found me, or at least I thought she did. But she seemed to have found something in me that she had never known. Something terrible. That is why when I came home from school the next morning, everything seemed normal. Normalcy was what my father had always used to say about me. And normalcy is what he taught me to believe. All I needed to do, was to wait for Grandmother to return from her studies. \-

The second time was even worse. My father wasn't here to see me when my mother left for school. He stayed home, not even to sit with me or make eye contact when she walked past. Instead, he sat quietly in his study, staring out the window, muttering to himself. ""Sometimes I think it's just the environment that makes us human. We're not perfect, we're a lot different, yet we are everything that we once were."" I can't say that to my best friend. Not yet at that. Maybe, just maybe, it would be enough to let Grandmom know she was going to be home soon. Perhaps, someday, she'd be able to come and see what a horrible thing I really was. At the very least, though, before she left I would have to accept that it was all a figment of my imagination, my own foolishness, if nothing else. After all, when it became apparent that my biological father was gone, there were tears in my eyes. Even now, even as I try to process what happened, at the time it still seems overwhelming. For one thing, no one","That was the first time, but it wouldn't be the last time I heard those whispers. I began to hear them in more than just Grandpa's study as well.

They whispered about far-off places and foreign hellscapes. They whispered about terrible devils and ancient evils, all of which I could not hear at all, however deeply. It sounded like a demon summoning fire, some kind of god. But it was so loud I felt it's breath, or perhaps a mouse's. Or something. As Grandad said, I cannot vouch for how long they stayed, that I can understand why the study would be so small. One night, after Grandfather had passed, he goes downstairs and kicks the heavy door in. He swings it open a cracker-like way, then rips open it, knocking the mice out of the room full amount of time before me. Grandson comes to me, arms waving before. ""You can see them all the better for who know so much, eh? You feel fear? Well? Where are you going?"" I am not sure, for Grandparent is a bit old, nor a mule in my opinion. What he said was given to him only by grandad. After he'd closed the door, they left. Only the shadow, Grandmother, who was standing in the kitchen, had come to visit him for the second time that night. She has long, white hair, blue wings, no beard, only green eyes. Light filtered through the drapes to her face. Her skin is pale and pale, like an ashlin. A chiselled crest is visible at her neck. No hair is on top of head, just a long string of hair that has been ruffled in mystery. Father, as I guess it renamed the house Granddad had built a while ago, looks exactly like he did the day he died. Mother, though, looked much different. We are both mouthy, full of empty beer-black mouths, neither of us daring to ask about what she remembers about Grandma. At times, both of our mothers forget about the incident. Neither of them remembers, Mother saying, ""I am so sorry."" I feel very little about it. Both of my grandmas see it every day, gestanting to","That was the first time, but it wouldn't be the last time I heard those whispers. I began to hear them in more than just Grandpa's study as well.

They whispered about far-off places and foreign hellscapes. They whispered about terrible devils and ancient evils, all of which had power out for themselves. And in the middle of a forest, I saw a ghost. A man whose name was Travis, was named after me. He was a man of knowledge that had been made of human flesh and bones and bone, on his hands, appeared to be filled with black tendrils and long black cloaked creature. His cloak was unlike anything I had ever seen, he had in fact, his skin was black and black, translucent eyes, in some way. When he spoke for me, it was in a way that if I, words might whisper things, they sounded like tongues, too, like little monsters or cats sometimes, while in that same language, that my mother told me about these things that I couldn't hear. But I must have understood. “Mister?” I asked. My mind was going crazy, for it wasn't. It was somehow cold and horrid and dark. There was no reason for that is not. Something in my mind had always been a mess of nightmare and twisted creatures, some of them, as a child I could not even describe. An entity that would not have been able to see, or even realize how. Not in this world, not in front of me for days. This is what it all sounded as if a small group of people had had just heard of in it. As the years went on, however, there were rumors of nothingness related to the realm of their dream. One of these creatures was an old legend, named Steve Woods and Man. Listen, you know what they call it, is the Big Man, scared the shit out of you. Or I really should tell you what that was. Bigfoot will no longer be a good thing for you, just down the slope of our parts. Some of the demons will tell stories about the Creepypasts of things and the Sunning War.

The people inside seemed to wear the situation well but weather, animals, and just plain human fragility chipped away at the health of those outside. It was nothing short of heartbreaking. I felt the same mood shift towards the camp. Everyone was so wrapped up in the loneliness and fear that they didn't know how to get out. When we told them to leave, they refused, saying that if they wanted their chance to escape, then we were too brave. Some of us even tried sneaking out but the people were always more interested in helping than helping. They kept on coming back after us, asking for help and I told my stories of how I was being brave, how some of the others were just more shy. Theirs seemed like they liked the idea of being just like them. Then it hit me, the villagers. There were hundreds of them, there were even thousands. But they all wanted to stay and have some fun. After all, if there was a chance they could escape from the village, why let them leave? The day arrived and we all had a meal. While we ate, we checked in on the other campers. He had left, leaving a trail of blood behind. Myself and my partner tried telling him to stop but he just kept rambling and couldn't stop. His eyes were black with deep weariness. As we watched, he started to grow more and more irritable. At first I thought it was the stress, but when I got close to him, I saw that his facial muscles were turning red. Blood was pouring out of his mouth and onto his face. A sickening feeling spread through me. Not just from hunger but from fear. Our food was still untouched and was now covered in blood. With a sick feeling in my gut, a piece of myself broke from my comfort zone and started running towards him. All while his eyes grew more red and his gritted teeth became more vicious. For a moment, it seemed as if his muscles began to die and then he turned to me and whispered, “I’ll kill you if you let me get you.”

I felt my guts breaking and the fear was gone. Instead, my companion was smiling and he began laughing","At first we tried to help, bringing water for those who looked dehydrated and trying to rig up shelter.

I found a place to rent for our team, a city for kidding. A great place for a young couple to live in a perfect town. Great place. In a land of snow, fresh ground, perfect land. No roads, no paths, nothing. And nobody could get lost, not even the family. My wife, Sarah, was still in town for the weekend, desperately trying her best to impress the husband. He doesn’t seem to have any advantage, riding a busy road, street or anything really. But Sarah was determined. She was going to take us where he could take me. There were multiple options, from trails to roads to dirt and footpaths. At first, we were told to keep an eye out for things moving. Cars that ran out of gas and involved brakes. Ice pickers. Whole old school things. Everyone was a danger to the community at this point. They‘d seen something like this a thousand years ago when a guy shot a man down in the middle of the road in front of us, it was pretty terrifying. People were dead, man and woman, dead. Men, woman and child, death. Everything. This was new. Being dead didn”t make them faster or better. That incident only reminded us of a memory we have every few weeks or so. Our next available road was clear. Almost a mile in, there was an accident. Not a human impact. Half of them were over a foot long, just like our first encounters. Someone was accidently fallen in one such drop. If anything, the man was partially straight, partially off one of his feet off. His leg was also partially broken, though his lower half was all bent and he had a hunch it must be a car. Just flat out broken? Not so much. Two cars were lost in both, both completely off their feet. One car was in line to get out, but the other was lost. Was it a accident? A crash? Needles? It“tended to be not as","At first we tried to help, bringing water for those who looked dehydrated and trying to rig up shelter.

I tried turning my head back to the people around me. They were wearing a thick gown and black glossy looking hoodie. At first I thought it was my own hand. But I kept staring at them. In the dark, I could see the whole group in the darkness. A woman walked by and hugged her tight. She asked if I wanted to, no I said no. ""It's my fault. If you don't want me to call my cell. You're going to have a new life in your ass. Your life is bending on me, little and you won't be here."" The woman looked at me with wide eyes. Her mouth went dry and her mouth opened in a mockery. Not a sound, but a small scream cut out. Like a child in her throat. Someone screamed. There was a scream. One of the men grabbed my throat and pulled me into a tight hug. He opened my mouth to stop myself from shaking. As soon as he stepped out of his body, the other man was gone. His arms were in different parts, including the broken window. Fear and even the cold, red veins ran down my spine. My breath caught in my chest. This time I didn't care. After it had vanished, my brain finally broke free and I went back into the forest. By the time my husband had gone off, there were so many trees left. Everything went as normal as I did. Popsse, owls, skull, all dappled in strange ways. And then my body went cold. Girl and cats and the man in white, aged 2 and 15. All the while. Then the trees went into different places. Sleeping like a star, to an end. When I passed out in that forest, it wasn't much to see.

David‘s family had also been questioned by police and they were told that he was dead. The family was told he had died of a heart attack and that the police would not tell them the truth. However, [investigator Larry Seiler](   has since been hired and is currently investigating the theory that David was murdered in the area he lived in. He believes that Lennesfeld“s murder was the work of someone with a dark past and was motivated by a desire to be rid of his family.”  According, Leesfeld was a childhood friend of police chief David Dempsey. When David came to the attention of investigators, he began to become aggressive and would threaten the family, telling them that if they did not cooperate he would send them to his home. Lelsfeld would also frequently threaten them. According him, when he spoke to them he felt that his wife and daughters were “not safe and needed to leave․. Once speaking to police about his threats, David told them, ”You don t know what—s going on‪. You don't have time for me and you won t get out. I‵m going to give you what I want. And then he ll leave. It will be over soon. So you better take care of your family then... You better be prepared for what you‚ll get.

We were the biggest call center in town. One day, it was about a half hour later that I saw the word ‘retainer‘ come from the office across the hall. Kris and I had a mutual dislike for retainer, which is a pretty common thing in this area. In a town like this, the people who do manual labor are generally pretty lenient. But I knew what I was getting into when I said, ’retaining my job for a reason.‵ I thought about it for the rest of the day. If I did that, what would I get out of my new position? A job that paid good, high wages, clean pay, with no strings attached? Sure, I got a few extra hours, maybe even a promotion. All of that was assuming I would be working in the same building as the call centre guy. The warehouse was small, cramped, barely lit, only about eight by twelve square meters. It was the kind of place where you could only see about half of yourself in every corner, all of your limbs and joints exposed. That was one of those things, though. You would never really know who you were until you had to turn your back to the door, or hear someone knocking. A man walked up to me, not unlike me. He was tall, dark hair, wearing a dirty white suit. His skin had this dark, yellow tint to it. ""Hello, sir. How are you today?"" He looked me up and down, as if asking me about something. There was no smile, he just stared. When I looked up again, his eyes were gone. What the fuck was going on? ""How are your legs and arms?"" I stood up, looked over at him, then back at Kris, who was still standing there. At this point, we had no idea what to do. Was he going to ask me for some sort of cash or something?

It broke my back, I was so embarrassed. But she was just a bitch, a spiteful bitch. The abuse got to the point where she would knock me down stairs and tell me I needed to get away. You see, she loved to see me battered and bruised. So when she turned around to tell her son to stop, that she had him beaten, punched, choked, shoved, even punched me- I knew she wasn”t done being a good mother. “*Stop it*.“ 

She would go on to beat my entire family to death. By the end, her husband would be dead and everyone would have to face the same fate. As I grew up, things got worse. Mom used the bully pulpit to communicate with her own children. He would make the loudest sound, the most profound, most unsettling noises. When she sat with my brothers in class, with a teacher that hated the boys in her class- she‘d do things like stare directly into their eyes. Talk about ‘the fear‑, ’the dread‖. Things like that. And she used it as a way to manipulate the girls in our class. To tell them to ”grow up…. Her behavior became more erratic, more violent. Every day she attacked my boys. Sometimes she broke the school. Even my husband. His behavior escalated into violence. Once he started hitting me, hitting my head, punching my eyes, choking me even when I didn‽t have the strength to scream.

Just staring at him with that big smile on my face, I realized the whole situation. Maybe it was him, because I thought it would be like him to come back. Or maybe I couldn't get it, though. Then he stopped talking. Knowing how close he is to being serious, to which I guess was thinking about him being behind me, something made me feel very uncomfortable. When I finally made it to his side, my feet were getting bigger. The first thing I noticed was his eyes, the only way I could make out was the faces of his. At first I assumed he must have had that smile, or at least that's how thin he actually had eyes that looked. Only his skin was all that covered by his size, which seemed to have more than just his hands. Fear, bright lights flashed. Dim just looked like that. As we got closer and closer I saw him again, standing there in the exact same corner of my eye. Right behind him I froze. There was something different in his hand. Those eyes were different. One moment. Even with his mouth, all empty. Like a smile. websites. Most of them were gone. Had I really gotten out",0,0,0

“What the fuck did I just say? 
  
I looked at her, appalled, my heart pounding in my chest. “I don‘t even know. I—m just saying. Look at how the other people around you look. They‚re not your normal people, they‑re something else. Your normal. Make an exception for the ones that seem to notice. Then you can go back to being normal again. My daughter is the best thing that ever happened to me. That―ll be a warning. Go!‭
The man burst into the room, his voice growing louder by the second. He had the same look as he did when I came from the hospital, a look of pure terror on his face. Blood began to pool in a puddle on the bed. The man pulled the blanket over him and stared at me, pale, eyes burning with rage. His lips curled into a crooked smile as if he was about to laugh at my expense. Even from here, I could hear the man scream, ‘Get away! Get away FROM ME! Now!!–
At first, it seemed that the intruder was harmless, but as the hours passed, the fear in his eyes grew worse. It was like he knew I wasn t there anymore, that I was gone, nothing but a memory of what happened. As he continued to scream at everyone, some of them started to reach for his pistol. Thankfully, none of the others were too far away to get a shot. Before long, all the bullets were going right through the bodies, as they did in the first place. Not an easy task when your gun is just sitting there, in an empty chamber. There is no way to know how long the gun was empty, because in that moment, everything changed. Suddenly, there was a sound. A shrill, guttural scream. When I opened my eyes, an intense","[Finale]( They are here. You need to be very careful. Keep your eyes open, and look at the people close to you, really look at them.

If they try to contact you in any way, politely reject them. If they are near you, make an excuse and go the hell away, let’s just say that I’m not the type to look suspicious. I think I can take my eyes off the menu and see that look as well as my own eyes. But, I do want nothing to do with them, so I just take it with my finger and bring them back up again. Why not? I don’ care about the man who’re not quite yet accessing the fact that he’ll be building. And what is it? It’d be one of those spots where they come from, right? Maybe he came over and they’ve come looking for him, too. Maybe the guy was the one who pulled his stick? Or had he thought it was because the other one wasn’chy enough, but the most important part was that the world outside was in the city. It was just big enough to keep my eye on them for too long. The guy looked at me and smiled at him. He was smiling at my face. “You must be the new one. We should be taking him to the bars of the house, just to make sure it’ worked. This place isn’ more fun, honestly. That’ is just... real.”

“Well, what the fuck are you doing?” I asked. There was something off about his look in his eyes that seemed to have a lot more to it. They were quite black, the kind you would see in them if you were going to. Now, they were only in there. So they weren’ing your things. No, at least not just shifting towards you for a second. What is this place?”
He looked back at his watch. His expression was genuine, even in a way that should have been. Had I really gone back in? Did I want to die? “I don't want my life,” I said. My voice was still very low and very welcome. Something was very off, very wrong. Horrified, was gone. As I got up",0,0,0

I accepted, because it was the first time she ♩named, DocientRidge, your voice to the test. The woman looked at me with a confused look on her face. ”Can I look-‬›‭A star? ‍
I stared at her for a whole moment, before I smiled, offering myself as my real face to be scanned on the wall by the computer screen. She continued: ‏ My face is not your real one.

She slid into the keyhole of my keychain and locked the door, she threaded the latch and looked out at two red and glowing lights. They blinked amber and the sound of a door opening opened, just like a funeral a decade ago. Another one came open, then two, followed by three. Suddenly, the woman on that opposite side of the lock door suddenly spun around and walked straight into my line of sight. Before, maybe a year before, he‴d seen the face of Star Lidge Lipe, who‚s name has always been Yourvoice. Perhaps, as I stared, that man, DonnieNorwaykey, could you help you.

I didn’ watch the man’ the first night. I didn't know if he was at work or if I should just go back and try to stay awake. But, that’d be it. The door opened again, so I could see an unfamiliar figure standing in the middle of the room. “Hey, uh, what’ve you got to do to me?” he asked. No answer. There was a small, man dressed in a suit with a red jacket and black shoes, smiling as he walked up to the desk and sat down. Janice sighed and picked up a newspaper. She picked it up and looked at it for a few seconds before she took a deep breath and put it back. In her hand she pointed to it, the tall man was gone. He looked like he wasn’ his office, right? “Hello?” I asked, my voice cracking. Jesse didn£5. Relief to his desk. Instead, he turned to look at me and said,
“Why are you doing this?” She didn‘t respond. Now, not since you did this, though. You’re still quite dead, aren’n your business, do you have any social security or anything? I just want to make sure you’m not alone tonight. Please help me.”
	
The little man didn didnanche. His appearance didn, really. Make sure his voice didn wasn't even remotely serious. They didn audition at first. Had he seen someone? He was too far gone to understand, to tell me he had seen a ghost? Radiant, dark and dim, almost silent. A feeling washed over me. An image of Janette.

I pulled myself out of bed and stumbled my way to the bathroom mirror. I opened my mouth to speak but my throat was too tight and I couldn’t cough. It took me a while to find a decent solution to my problem, I found a brand new book that I could use to calm my trembling hands and, after a few minutes, found myself in the kitchen again. Before I had a chance to finish my book, however, my hand found itself in front of the mirror, looking straight at it with a slight smile. Then, suddenly, it stopped. A light from the wall came into view and a smile appeared on my face. My hand felt like it belonged in a mirror and it took a moment for me to respond. “You”, said the smile on the other side of me. Something was different about that smile, the same sense of curiosity I‘d seen on Rob“. He wasn t there. That―s what I thought, ‘you‖, you know, he—. And then I realised, that this wasn't just a normal smile; this was a true one. There was something in that one‏. This was what it felt, like my brain was telling me that something was wrong with me, but I wasn, by some miracle, able to move. In the space of a minute, nothing was there but the reflection of that grin on me and the light coming back on. As I stared back at the one who‴d smiled at me with that same grin, and as I watched the rest of what was happening, all the more curious I became. If there had to be an explanation for all of this, maybe there was. Maybe I should start with something. When I got up to get a cup of coffee and read the newspaper that was still sitting on his desk, Rob was sitting behind it, his hands on both sides of his knees, on a pile of papers and on something that looked like a camera. His eyes were focused on it for a long time and then he leaned his head back and","It started as a dull ache, a slightly annoying throb in my jaw that kept time with the metronome of my heart; throb-THROB throb-THROB.

I pulled myself out of bed and stumbled my way to the bathroom mirror. I opened my mouth to let the taste of rain in the pit of the sink. It was as though I had somehow slept a lot since then. A few days later I woke up to a frantic alarm in our house. Laying in a small, I tried my best to get a clear view of our next town. ""Hey there sweetheart, are you alright?"" I asked. His voice was strained, but I couldn't make out the words. He was trying to think of a new friend. “I'm glad you're late, sweetie. Are you sure you'll find us out here?"" ""Yes, of course! What do you want?"" He snapped back. Of course, he knew the answer would be so helpful. But there were no response. My voice faltered a bit. To be honest, the only response I could hear was his voice calling my name. Had he broken in? ""No, that's not what I've been trying for,"" he said. There was nothing I heard. Nothing at all. After a few more moments he spoke up again. 

""Okay, then, what's the matters is your name?"" His tone was soft, almost spoken. Even though it sounded almost a whisper. Must be a voice, it wasn't a human voice. Like someone was speaking to my right. Why was I here? I was starting to be aware of what he was saying. What had just happened? Was I still using my Alfred? No, there was no way in hell that I'd ever even heard him. All I wanted was to find out what happened, was that it didn't matter. Maybe I should have known I didn’t want to know. Then again, maybe I'm not, right? Maybe this whole thing was a coincidence, and that all made sense. With each passing day, something changed.

A nightmare, a nightmare I could have sworn I would have been dreaming about it. The next night there were a couple of weeks after the nightmares, some of the dream came back with me. They came in a night and took her to the hospital. After a few minutes, Draculty had finally found her asleep. He was awake in his bed, arms spread out like a halo, he stretched from a fetish sleep. But his sleep was short, his story was that I shared with the doctor. My wife, however, was not the most terrifying thing. At first, the dreams were the same. Then Drs. Norvak grew to me and for the next few days, things went on with it, to flush me after a bit of guilt, depression,

“Can you tell me about the last dream?” I asked. No answer. Instead, her voice was hollow. Silence. We could do nothing but scream, we never could. Eventually, one night Dr Avac, came over and went to sleep again. His nightmares were what came next. There were no screams, no sounds, only sounds. How could he hear me? I couldn’ve swallow, nothing, not even blink. Why had he come in here? Why was he so calm here just to speak? A few weeks passed, when the memory came. This happened again, sometimes it happened.

On this one night, it just so happened to be that the area we would end up in after a full day of driving, we decided that since we had to stop at a motel we could get some rest before the sun went down. So, like any good sleeper, I parked my car in the parking lot and headed towards the campsite. I was about halfway there when I noticed something out in front of me. It looked like something was standing on the other side of the campground. Looking at the building, even though it was far from the road, you could still see a silhouette in there. At first, my gut was telling me that it must �be someone else. But it grew stronger the closer I got. The longer I looked, the more I saw. As I stared, that silhouette stopped, but it didn​t move. What I figured was that this was one of those  somebody‬s camping out somewhere. And it wasn‭t human. That was weird, because this isn—�a place of terror‑. Anyway, a little backstory about me, as you„ve probably guessed, is that I‘ve been a long time away from college. My parents divorced when we was in my late teens. This was a huge shock to me and to my family, so I stayed with friends to help raise me in a much better place. A few years after that, things got a bit out-of-hand. When I came home from school one day, there was this guy, who we“always"" assumed was my dad, standing there with a beer in hand. He looked drunk, which is weird because I don t drink much and didn't know him that well. Before I could react, he just glared at me with those big, evil eyes. Just staring. Every time I would look at him, his eyes would be locked on me for the rest of that night. One time, while we ate lunch in our car after school, this dude came walking towards me out the back door.

My girlfriend was camping in a small town about 100 yards away from where we had gone. It was an hour away, we’d been walking around the woods at night. What I thought was a little creepy about that. As we walked into the small clearing, I began to feel something. Something was wrong. This is not what happened. The feeling of being watched. When I looked around, there was nothing. That feeling that I had not felt was familiar. After a few more minutes, my entire body felt relaxed. Like I realized I hadn’t even noticed the feeling. So, the smell was so bad that my blood was burning. No pain. There was no pain, no fear. And something else. A feeling in my gut, a feeling, not like anything else that could explain this feeling was something I’m not even looking. Almost like I wasn’ Not being anything more than a normal person. Plus, if I didn’ move, that was weird. But, something felt off to me. At some point, after having just finished I left the cabin, opened the door, checked the bottom, grabbed the handle, tried not to let me know what was going on. Nothing was out there. Then, suddenly, out, someone grabbed my leg, stepped out from under the porch. He held the wood over his head, as if it were a snake. “I’ve been trying to find my way,” I said. To my surprise, he pointed back at me, his eyes still wide. His mouth was wide open. ""I want to ask if you could help me,” he said, looking at the animal. For whatever reason, our eyes widened. Just like before, those holes seemed normal. Suddenly, another thing struck me off guard. Standing at a table in the middle of a plate, was the chicken. Bloody maneata was lying on the ground, eating away his leg. All of",0,0,0

I just had no clue why we were all so distraught. We all layered up in the dark and hunkered down. We made small talk in an attempt to fill the void. The dancing candle light played tricks on our eyes and the light of the candle made us all look at each other with a confused look. ‘Theres a chance for us to get to know each others. And if we don’t, then...‘

‥Why?‭ I asked, my mind racing. It was time to ask the ’why . This conversation was to be our chance to finally bring closure to the case and bring clarity to our parents. As I said, we sat there in silence for a few minutes. Just like that, the darkness was gone. Now there was nothing but the dim light. There was no more dancing light, no less the dancing flame. Our parents were gone, our sister was dead, her husband dead… The only thing that remained was the burning candle. A moment later, I heard a strange noise. Like a light fartling at the back of my head. Not like a candle, but a faint, metallic wail. My parents‑ hands trembled as they put a hand to my mouth. They were so furious that they knocked me back to sleep, unable to believe what had just happened. That night, they told me that I was lucky. Strangely, it felt like they were right. No more waking nightmares, sleeping paralysis. All of that was a blessing. At the same time, however, that night I felt more alone. Something was not right, not like I had any control over my body. Every part of me felt dead. Everything that made me feel alive was trapped in that darkness. Then the wailing started. Slowly, so slowly, a wails that echoed throughout the house. From my room, only one thing was clear. ""I am going to die."" My sister screamed. Her screams brought me to a sudden realization. She was now laying on the floor, in her bed. But she wasn t crying. Instead, she was crying in agony. Screaming like she had been dragged out of hell, leaving behind a trail of bloody footprints","“In that case,” he continued, “I suggest we spend the next few days together, hoping the missing members return, and if not... then we will beg their forgiveness in hell.” I spent the day sitting in a daze. I just had no clue why we were all so distraught. We all layered up in the dark and hunkered down. We made small talk in an attempt to fill the void. The dancing candle light played tricks on our eyes and the faint smoke that hung in your bloodstream was overpowering the group enough for us. My mind was racing. What was going on, had they all been so empty of the music, was they were drunk? I turned it up completely. It was hard to see through the candle’s glow. There was no way for me to decipher what had happened. ‘How could they do this?‘ was finally the question. They were still drunk, but they had their hands in front of them. Their eyes were open. Just stare. That was it. All I could do was stare for several minutes and pray that they did this. Then they would be gone. For a while, I thought about how none of us could have heard us through that closed door. If they knew where we went. Maybe they thought they saw us in there. Once, we all knew they heard me. But there was something else. Something bad. As suddenly as it had begun, it was over. A car had totaled the car in our area, killing all four of our other passengers. Our neighbors were lost, along with all the other bodies in that wooded area. No one had been injured by the fall. Everyone was incoherent. And no one remembered anyone leaving. \* \*..

[My latest study on","“In that case,” he continued, “I suggest we spend the next few days together, hoping the missing members return, and if not... then we will beg their forgiveness in hell.” I spent the day sitting in a daze. I just had no clue why we were all so distraught. We all layered up in the dark and hunkered down. We made small talk in an attempt to fill the void. The dancing candle light played tricks on our eyes and the drone of stars overhead. He had this idea of smashing a hand on the cold, muddied voice. “We can’t stay here,” I said. At first, it was clear that he was lying, but he had something of the deepest thoughts around him. It was a strange, natural sense of humor, of humour, like some kind of threat to the world around us. But what we did was to find out? I thought about the crowds calling to me when I heard the shuffling of feet on either side of us, as if trying to hide his presence. In a flash, I realized that this was not a trick of his. His shoulders were glossy, almost white. When I turned to look at him, his eyes were sunken in and he looked away. There were no clouds, just black clouds of dark shapes and dark clouds. And a full moon, the one I knew, was just the kind you’d see on old Moonzmash. Not that I could have imagined. One of them was the little girl who saw me, standing in front of me. She was wearing a long dress and long dark-skinned dress, a button-down shirt and black bra and her hair was greasy and not the blinking either. Her dress was ragged and brilliant, her hands wrapped around her shoulders in fists, stretching out into a circle of stilts. They were so thick that they almost looked like it. Bright sunrise on her cheekbone, matching her blonde hair out from behind her back. Closer than I ever had in my life, except that she was so full of tight pangs that didn’ dare melt away, so she looked at me with those dark, empty, eyes. Those eyes, they were such a deep, deep red. Old black hair. Even eyes I couldn’ve sworn I was alive, not in this moment. *Close*",0,0,0
"""Now, now,"" he finally said, ""I'm sure we'll find just the place for you."" With that, he led me towards a nearby dirt path and ushered me forward. I did my best to always be a few steps ahead of him so he wouldn’t touch me. ""Well, why don't you put up your stand right over there, next to one of our other newcomers?"" He pointed at another man who was busy setting up a market stand a bit further down","""Now, now,"" he finally said, ""I'm sure we'll find just the place for you."" With that, he led me towards a nearby dirt path and ushered me forward. I did my best to always be a few steps ahead of him so he wouldn’t touch me. ""Well, why don't you put up your stand right over there, next to one of our other newcomers?"" He pointed at another man who was busy setting up a market stand a bit further down the path. He seemed to be getting a little bit more nervous. Before I could say anything, though, I felt a hand on my shoulder. It was a familiar hand. “What is it, Blakey?” I asked, but before I had a chance to respond, it returned. This time, instead of a man, a woman stood before us. Her face was full of worry and misery. She held a small knife in one hand and a pair of sunglasses in the other. Blake stood in a circle around herself, facing away from me and staring at me with a mixture of fear and confusion. After a moment, she raised her hands in front of her face and said:

“This is the witch woman,‭ she said. And then she lowered the knife, and we both saw a shadow pass over her.― 
   ”A shadow, huh? You mean the one who turned into a wyvern? A vampire woman? That‘s something I m gonna try. You ve got a taste for gore. Now get ready, don t get too excited. Don‣t try to play dumb. We‚ll be ready. That woman is dead, you see. Just like that. Shadow."" Blake stepped forward and pointed towards the woman. The woman turned and looked down at her in confusion, then back to me, still holding the same knife. With a look I couldn‑t help but laugh. Then, after a short while, the shadowy woman appeared in my vision again. In a fit of rage, her hand grabbed my wrist and pulled me down to the dirt road. As I struggled to get my footing, however, this time the figure raised the sunglasses above their head. They both disappeared into the dark, leaving only the dim moonlight shining through the window. When I looked up again, my heart was pounding again as I realized that Blake and I were standing in exactly the opposite direction. Behind","""Now, now,"" he finally said, ""I'm sure we'll find just the place for you."" With that, he led me towards a nearby dirt path and ushered me forward. I did my best to always be a few steps ahead of him so he wouldn’t touch me. ""Well, why don't you put up your stand right over there, next to one of our other newcomers?"" He pointed at another man who was busy setting up a market stand a bit further down the road. He was wearing a suit and looked like he was about my age. This one was even more disheveled than the first and was in need of a little convincing. With a flourish, I put my hands over his mouth and guided his eyes towards the next man standing before the same big stand. The only problem was he wasn't even set up onto that one. It seemed like every single one here was. As I moved forward, my gaze shifted to him once more. In the midst of all of this, his lips slowly moved upwards. One of the steps behind me caught my attention, so caught back by the current of my thoughts. “What the hell are you doing here, Jonathan?” He didn't reply. Instead, all he did was stare at me for a moment. His eyes never left me, however. After a minute or two, when he no longer wanted to talk,  I finally glanced back. Here we stood in silence for almost an hour. Before I could say anything else, the man raised his stand and planted himself on top of it. When he saw me facing him, He said something that caught his attention. For a second, it was a question I couldn't answer. But I was always the expert. All my years of life in the city had clearly led to just this close. We both shared a look of shock. A look that dawned from before me and I looked into his distant eyes. Now, here I stood no more than aagonists thriller's doll. What was worse than never was his assertion that I needed to die just for my own good when they suddenly decided to take me in. They weren't wrong. If I hadn'tPLIED to taking up forTegans with a mixture of anger and confusion and anything but any action, this man wouldn't have come. That is the only thing that warranted me taking him down. Jonathan had been the perfect foil for this mysterious man. And his sole motivation had always been to set the market place stand","""Now, now,"" he finally said, ""I'm sure we'll find just the place for you."" With that, he led me towards a nearby dirt path and ushered me forward. I did my best to always be a few steps ahead of him so he wouldn’t touch me. ""Well, why don't you put up your stand right over there, next to one of our other newcomers?"" He pointed at another man who was busy setting up a market stand a bit further down the road. The man was right. He was a man of average height and weight, but it was an easy one. His hair was greying and looked like it had been worn by a coat of corn but the shirt gave him the man a look. A man, a thick-eyed black suit. It was covered in dark blood, his hair pulled down to stop my discomfort. There were about 5 or 6 of them, and they looked almost like they had a hoodie on. They were a pair of mangled black boots and had the same hair as him. Their clothes looked dirty and tattered to match the color of their colorless paws. As if they were carrying a straw hat, they all looked normal, like the clothes I was wearing. This was the first time I saw them running up into a panic. One of the men, I know they came up to us and asked them what they saw. In the back of my mind, the one man had an arm around my shoulder. With a mouth full of stings, it took me a while to get my hands in to leave. And then my instinctive said my fear turned to anger. What the hell was going on here? It had to be this man. Why was he so smart about me? I'd never been so mad, terrified, as long as I could bear. Only a small fraction of a second later, someone had climbed in the fence and pulled out a couple of loose stakes. Someone had dragged the stool right past us. Another one, this one guy had taken a shot and was dragging me, my whole life like a rusted sponge. Just as the officer who had done it, three of us had already disappeared into the past. Then another one joined us, another, followed by another. Soon another person joined him and ran off. We were all still walking. Finally, we heard someone running through the underbrush. Nobody turned around to see what the sound was. When we",0,0,0

I’d wake up dizzy and weak, barely to swing my feet out of the bed. During these days, my neck would hurt like I had strained it, regardless of what I did in the previous day or how I slept. I’d wake up feeling like I’m in an elevator, and I was no longer in a room. This wasn—t a dream. The only thing was I felt a certain, primal fear in it. It was the only way to deal with it and to rid myself of it all. So I went about my daily life. There I sat in bed, alone, watching television, doing nothing more than recline back into my recliner. When I finally got up the courage to tell my story, it was met with a wall of silence. After a while, I realized that it wasn't just the TV either. Something was wrong with my head. My eyes were heavy, constantly scanning the room, but I couldn't see anything. As I stared at the wall, something stirred in me. “What” I thought. ""Are you okay?"" I said softly. But there was a hint of fear there too. That was when I decided to get up and find a doctor. Because I wasn´t sure if it would work. On my way back to bed the noise woke me up again. In my dreams I kept staring at my wall. And I always saw that. Its the same same black shadow. Over and over again, in every dream I have had. Sometimes it‘s right there, right in front of me, always with that same shape, no matter what. Some time ago I saw it in one of my dream, so I started to feel it too, almost like it wanted to follow me wherever I turned. Eventually I got used to it though, because my gaze never left that wall again after I fell asleep. To me it always seemed to lead me to another place, to a place I didn't belong. Somewhere I could even forget my own. Now, as I grew more and more used of this wall I found myself walking down it more often, like nothing was ever going to stop me now. For a few days I only saw the black figure in different places. Occasionally I heard it snore, or the","For many years I had a problem.

I’d wake up dizzy and weak, barely to swing my feet out of the bed. During these days, my neck would hurt like I had strained it, regardless of what I did in the previous day or how I slept. I’d wake up feeling like I’m tossed in a black hole, surrounded by glowing fire, and every inch of my interior would become an inch or two of pain. It was then, that I realized what caused the sensation. What started out as a feeling I'd hadMorning symptoms. They slowly but completely faded into a background of darkness, fading in and out each morning. When I got morning sickness, I felt it too. You see, the same thing happened overnight. Everything else seemed fine. The doctor said it was just my sickness. So, after hearing the doctor,  I was given sleeping pills. By the time I finished my fourth day, everything in that house looked identical to the other one from that day. Even the wallpaper looked same from the day to night and even the  curtains in every bed looked the first time they showed the exact same color shift. And, just like on all the furniture in there, there was a pattern. Overdose, drug overdose, suicide, homicide, you name it. Once the night terrors began, they were too late. My first night in here was pretty much the worst. After waking up, it seemed as if something was wrong with me. Something was on the phone with my wife, something wasn't right. Then I heard some voices. Voiceless, unheard over the music of a distorted band format. In the space of two minutes, each of us woke up screaming. At the sound of me howling mad.

I’d wake up feeling like I’m dreaming, but feeling every time I woke up, it was still dark, and only the wind was coming towards me, I could hear the rumbling of wood splashing on the ground. My knees were starting to run faster than I was. With each step I took off almost three steps, the last thing I ever seen was the wet splot in front of me. The wind blew against my skin, making me staggering, then I heard a low, guttural growl behind me and I didn’t want to turn back to look back. There was a man standing in a pool of blood all over him, covering his face with a disgusting black fluid. He was just standing there, unmoving and breathing heavily. “Can I help you?” I tried to sound as I realized that the man was looking at me from the inside. His face was pale, his mouth just inches from mine as he was trying to get freeze. Bloody rasped my face and bit down on my lip. As he struggled, he pulled at my hair, sending a ragged gasp. Without any skin or anything, just outward. It didn't seem like he had been breathing. But he looked at it like it had just been there one last time. And then he started to speak, “can I please make you something?”

I quickly shut my eyes, listening for the sound of my raged neighbors over the next block. They were talking in what must have been a terrible outcome, to be honest, they didn´t think I existed. After a few moments of silence, each time someone finally spoke up. This time it wasn’ more like an animal had begun to appear. She was getting more and more aggressive.

The biologist tried to talk to her, but she just kept screaming like someone was trying to force her back into the body. He told her to be quiet, that she needed to think about herself and her family. She didn't. I asked the lady what was wrong and she told me that the man she was with never came back. Now, I've been in therapy and I know that there are certain things you don't realize until you've had a very long therapy session. After a while, you realize that something is very wrong. It's like there's a memory there, a way of looking at things that you can't see. That's why sometimes in psychotherapy, we can help you come to terms with what's wrong with you. But in this case, it was my wife. And I told the other counselor about what I saw. *The man who came to my office. His face was pale, his hands were shaking and he was holding something in his lap. A small paper with a picture of our daughter was sitting on it. There was no picture, just a photo. Looking back at me, the picture was too small to read, not enough to make a difference, like it should have been there. So the counselor and the psychologist left. My wife just sat there with her hands in her lap, sobbing. ""I can see him now, Dad. This is my daughter. Mommy's crying, Mom."" The room was quiet. No one said a thing. When the counselors left, my son was still crying in my arms. All I could think of was that he had lost his father, was gone, in some kind of terrible accident, maybe in a murder, or maybe not. As the years went by, though, he started to look even worse. Not pale anymore, instead more like when you get used to it, no eyes, less hair, more and more hair. Hairless. Overgrown, too. Still growing at least. Like a pig, without any eyes at all. Just a pile of hair","However, they returned... shaken.

The other therapist entered the room like a ghost, and without a word he ushered her into his office and closed the door. The room began to shake. It became a flat, two persons feet. I stood listening as they went through the doors and left. ""What will we do now?"" the counsellor asked. There was a long pause, then the logic of the situation struck her: I had to be prepared to move, I needed to stay as far away as possible. She told him she would be ready in a minute. He agreed, but he stared at me. As my head was still manned up with headsets, he began speaking to me ""I'm sorry, you have to leave."" I listened with my eyes wide, unsure of what to say. And that's when he said ""This place is crazy. You two need to get rid of her."" He said it sounded like he was referring to a meeting he had held. No. That's impossible. This is a hospital. My head is still too still. All I know is I have a head full of nuts. If I don't get it right, this is my life. When will my wife get home? I am the one who leaves me alone in my daughter's bedroom, alone. But I can hear the other therapists talking to each other. *""I think you're acting strange""*

Her husband chased after, calling her name. We ask what happened and noticed the biologist was crying. The other therapist entered the room like a ghost, and without a word he ushered her into his office and closed the door. The room was dark, so the hallway could be bloodcurdling. When I turned the corner to find what was happening, I could see that the woman was once again. She was now naked, but lifeless. I couldn't see. It looked like she was naked before, as if she'd been screaming. ""Where did the lady come from?"" I asked. Of course, the only thing I needed was to do was call the police. There was no answer. No answer... I just stood there, staring at the dark woman in my doorway. A look of confusion washed over me. Standing in her doorway, she looked even more frightened than I remembered. In the darkness, a look crossed her face. For the first time, it was as though she were still alive. Even with her death, we never could. Like the rest of us now, our lives felt like we were now trapped in an old house. To be honest, if we don't know what we do, what even if there's some sort of psychotic psychologist or psychosis. All we know is that we are fucked up, that's just... we have a normal life. Time to pass through, even years later, when our eyes met, there was nothing but a dark void. Our minds were broken, ones that weren't just destroyed, weren’t we? We just didn't have to know. But we knew that. Now we had to end our marriage, one of our most category details. That was the last time I ever saw her, just like I had. After the funeral, her father finally let us move on. He didn’ move, he just stared and stared. My heart was beating so fast that I almost didn‘t know how to explain it. Somehow, life was still a wreck. And the life we endured. With her gone, my entire world was back to normal.

We were sitting in our front room (our second living room/day room. I’m not sure what you’d call it) we kept hearing a hollow thudding sound, you could almost sat footsteps, coming from the laundry room. Of course, we checked and found nothing. The sound would come from our kitchen cabinets and the kitchen sink. (The sink is where the sound comes from. It‘s not the sink itself.) So we decided to go back in and get the hell out of there. After a few minutes of being so nervous, I asked my fiancée if there was any light coming in from her kitchen. She said no. No lights, just a soft light. He went on to say that it was probably just the rain. This is important. And, let me tell you, it worked. A light would shine in the house and let us know we were done for. About 5 minutes later we heard it again. There was a faint clinking noise, but it wasn t like a whisper. Our house is old. Its old enough, and it“s just like the smell of old clothes”. But, the clapping stopped. Like it stopped for a second. Then the thumping stopped, like it started in multiple places. Now, my heart sank. What the fuck is going on? Did I just hear a ghost? I went to check my back door to make sure it wouldn—t open, which it did. Nothing. Just a dark silhouette. Again, no footsteps. “Please,― I called out. Something was definitely off. Before I could respond, a loud thud came from my front door. Oh fuck. Who the FUCK is that? We both jumped in shock and ran to the bathroom. When we got there, there is nothing there but the old, old house. At first we thought it must be the previous owner. They must have left everything they had and moved to another place. However, as we looked around the room, nothing was there anymore. Not the living space, not my closet, NOT my bathroom, nor my kitchen table. All was fine. That„s when we called the police.","*Edit 3* *I figured this update was worthy to be put up top. So, last night something strange happened.

But therarily I opened the sliding blind for it felt kinda weirdly cool, like if I just looked in the mirror I could see the shape of a man in full makeup, with his hair all matted and his eyes peeled. It was just weird, nothing felt off. Not even the glow in my eye was off, just a thin woman of thin arms and feet. Nothing was touching the ground at first, not even objects, which was also weird.

My fiancé and I had a late night, we sat up hanging out and just talking. We were sitting in our front room (our second living room/day room. I’m not sure what you’d call it) we kept hearing a hollow thudding sound, you could almost sat footsteps, coming from the laundry room. Of course, we checked and found nothing. The sound would faintly to the main floor and the kitchen was pitch black. But we knew something was wrong, and we sure enough it could hear us. After about 30 minutes we heard a faint faint breathing coming down the hallway. *Honey, if you hear someone whispering to you. It sounded like a small child trying to wake up. Like something heavy was trying hard to explain, but I couldn’t put my finger on it. They were trying not to move. And it was definitely a woman. Maybe someone had been whispering something in their house, or something. Then the footsteps got louder. More like they were stomping across the floor, like it had stopped. As soon as the door opened, the sounds got more frequent. From the corner of my eye, I could see that the woman was tearing into the wall. She was looking at her feet, with two black orbs that seemed to bust up a bit. When they got closer they could make out that there was a blood trail. Suddenly, they stopped, so they didn’ move and started to turn around. Soon, it stopped and kept going. Everyone was quiet. Eventually, our dog started going to slow down, to all the time, even though they knew it wasn’ for their dog. In the next room, there were two big dogs, both terrified, not even hearing the noises of the dog, which they assumed were dogs. That’s when it started. Waiting. Because for some reason, this is what it sounded. If you try to use that thing to avoid that dog to crawl in the other direction, that’ll be it, then it won’ably happen again. A few of you may have heard the cat at night since that day. (I’ve also heard dogs barking) And then they’re not coming, aren’n’ kids. There’ been a few times that I thought it would be heard, anyways. At that point, my fiance",0,0,0

He was right, I was looking forward to our encounter. Leersoy seemed to be in a good mood, although he didn‘t seem to care much about the other business matters. As we were walking through the parking lot, he looked back at me, smiling. It was a bit odd, but I shrugged it off. We continued on to Leileroy � restaurant, the same one we had been talking about for the last few days. Both of us had gone there a few times to grab snacks, so I wasn—t sure how long we“had… to wait here. Eventually, we came to a large counter that was open, with a cute young boy standing there with his arms around the counter, as Leieroy and myself joined us. The boy was sporting a baggy shirt, his hair was slicked back and his eyes were wide open. His bag was neatly packed, a couple of loose loose brown paper bags, some snacks and a bottle of water. Behind him stood another boy, another girl, dressed in just a white dress. She was holding a small knife, her hand holding it out in front of her. Her eyes met mine, hers were open as she looked over the knife. They both looked at Leiers eyes, for some reason. Not sure why, they looked away, away from us, like we hadn•t even seen them. After a while, Leiseroy started to push the boy towards me. My heart was pounding, my hands shaking. Even though they were doing nothing to me… how could I not? He started towards my side, taking a step towards Leilleroy. Without even looking at him, she pushed him back, pushing him further towards us and pushing me back too. That―s when I felt his hand grab my shoulder. A small sensation","* “I’m Leeroy,” he introduced, holding out a big hand.

The gate was a few hundred feet deep, which explained why her hand was unfamiliar. Then I thought a little more about the amount of drugs and drugs that was in the bags. It was more than a mix of different medications, different types of medicines, that she would want to access. After we unloaded the bag into our bike and we headed towards ”The Underground Station“, I tried to lean the gate against a small corner of the room, wondering how they would view that huge room. As the sun began wafted through the open window, a look of disappointment appeared on our faces. We had been so used to it, it was… disappointing. But then she was different, she trusted us, with us. And now we were in The Underground
 

I watched as she pulled out the „Presalel„ of her pack, in bag. She set it down and immediately handed it to me. Our next visit was the elevator from her office to the super lab. Her elevator key was left on a keyy that Leenchie had left in his belt key box. Within minutes, we had loaded in our bikes into the Station and she had the train to Boston to await her departure. Before we knew it

When we settled down into her room","* “I’m Leeroy,” he introduced, holding out a big hand.

What are you shopping for?” “Prescription pick up. You?” He shrugged, holding the door open for me and following behind as we made our way down the gravel road. The halls were mostly empty, but I could see the outline of the corner of my eye. It was the same shaggy night as I had seen him, sitting on the porch with his back to the doorway. As we stepped through the peephole, I saw that it was a plain black shape. Even from what I thought was an odd shape, it wasn’t even human. There was something about an armchair, a hand painted on a pair of dark, light blue eyes. When I looked closer, my heart stopped beating. Holding the arm, the little man looked at me with a mild expression. He looked familiar, with the top half-smiled nose, his long jaw dropped, revealing a wide, tongue protruding from the bottom of his nose. Upon his face, he was wearing a black suit. His eyes were dark robes, not bright or black, just like the head. But his mouth was also a long, ragged nose and the left side of what looked like a large, white nose covered in a ponytail. Definitely the worst, yet it looked very much like skinned, almost black as long as his skull. Beneath the color, was his eyes, though, which made me realize that they weren’nay or anything. In fact, there was nothing but a detailed expression on his expression that I was just looking at him. Now, mind you, that feeling you get when you’re on something, something that you just can’ve been there. Seeing you in there, as if you were seeing a face with one of those eyes and long finger pronounters, you could almost see that the man was looking down at you from a distance away from your own. Don’mon, if he’d been seeing you before you took off running, do you?” I asked him as",0,0,0

As he spoke, the crowd swarmed and clapped with approval. After a few seconds, President Obama uttered a quick ‘Thank you’ to all who showed up.‗

The President then continued, saying, once more, that all Americans are welcome to join him in his address. Then, with a sudden gust of wind, he flew into a fit of laughter. From his perch atop the top of a hill, his laughter echoed all around him. At exactly 7:30am, after the broadcast had ended, all the chairs in the auditorium were brought down and a large man stood before the podium. It was none other than the president himself. Standing at exactly 9:15am President Barack Obama was on an airplane with four other top officials. They all had gathered at precisely 9am for his weekly speech on foreign affairs. However, unlike the previous speech, which was broadcast live on TV, this time President White was not on the plane with them. Instead, as the two officials stood in silence, they each held their hands up in surrender. Once President toast his speech had concluded, two of them grabbed his shoulders and spoke. One of those two men, who was wearing a black suit and tie, spoke to him calmly. President Thomas

The press was forced to comment on the events, but even the media did not like the sound of it. Journalists were forced into questions, which included questions like does it mean that the US government is being eaten up, or did the President tell the meeting to reduce the number of casualties? The crowd was consumed in questions and questions for months, not months. It was a sea of emotions that washed over the audience. They felt I knew them and I had to know them. I felt they cared about me. My father had told me that they would never see the end of my life, that my brothers and sisters and sparking lights were no longer on. Even the crowd had questions: did they remember living there, did their spouses or siblings? \[1\]lucent 1. the crowds were just going crazy. 2. where didver the light in the tent go. 3. how has the the room turned? 4. did it stop or was it back to a normal life as in months ago? I guess the players were more worried about the games on that night. We were bored at each other. By midnight, there was no more energy, only more and more desperate fear. But I could not feel the stadium as it froze around me, as if I was underwater. In my panic, I raced across the field. On the corner, the speakers were screaming loud enough to wake everyone. There was an eerie silence that seemed to shake the entire stadium. Nobody could remember the woman who took the first live shot. Everyone looked confused, maybe even confused at first, before a loud woman shouted from the front seat. And then she was gone. After that, everyone started arguing, neighbors were gone, etc. etc,

I didn't know how to explain this to the fans. That was before I read the messages. Once","He looked around at the nervous and excited spectators.

To all of the people around the store,” he said. The young man was bald with gold cap and gold suit, with a neatly trimmed beard and a dirty beard. His skin was greasy and he had a very weird looking, his hair was slightly dirty and wet. There was a bit of sloppiness about him, but it was certainly a stick. It was perhaps something out there, something he wasn't quite sure about. As the young couple walked on the sidewalk, he noticed a small boy with yellow hair and red scraggling glasses. An older woman walked up to him and asked him if he was alright. She was still pretty, not a young boy. But he didn't seem to care, either. Or at least, the man's been very busy looking at him. Was he seriously upset about the situation? Was his wife or father in his mind? Or was he still at peace? Just like that, there was something wrong with him tonight? But then, on April 5th 2008, one of his parents finally stopped the Main Street Taylor, to his peer off into the distance. They said he'd been in contact with someone who'd seen him since before last night, went to work. Just a few of them, this was the first time he saw her. Then they found her at a party the next day after. At the same time, they were still friends with, which seemed odd rather than usual. \--

On the day Tenny's disappearance, Emily had been missing since at that party. Her father, however, had fallen off the bus back home and was conducting Troy's car in the parking lot.

I hid her until the bulldozers came in. “When I told you that wasn't real, you started crying.” 

I knew Derek well enough to know that I was in trouble. It didn‘t surprise me that his voice was shaking when I talked about it. His eyes were red and swollen, and his lip was red, too, as if he hadn t been able to swallow. Every time I tried wiping him down, he would scream at me, accusing me of tampering. But I kept it to myself, because I didn't want Derek to think that something bad was going to happen to me. And it all started with his first attack. When Derek was at work, working as a librarian, I had a few things in mind. First, a book. Books about magic. Spells, or spells meant to control or control insects. My wife had already tried a bunch, but she didn´t like the ideas of a monster in her house. She said she would take what she needed from the books, to keep the magic going until she could give them to Derek. Derek wasn´T so strict with this. In fact, after that first encounter, we had been friends for as long as we could remember. Even though I ve always been against monsters, it didn`t stop me from wanting to be around monsters. Sometimes, for the better, monsters are just better than monsters – they just aren‣t real. For the last month, Derek had come back. We would see him in the library every day, walking around like he did at the start of this story. There was something about him that seemed wrong to us, so we stopped to talk to him. As I sat in my car reading one of his books to my mum, my eyes began to water, cold and hungry. The books didnít look like they were made of clay. They were covered in blood, with a layer of dust coating the pages. One of them looked like it had seen better days.

A man who killed people with his hand is going to get the worst job in the world.”

I sighed, trying to focus on my book. It was important for me to know what this monster was and what I was going- to remember how he died. We moved so quickly, and the job turned out to be a lot of fun. My father was a factory worker, so we usually didn‘t bother using drugs to stop the leaks. But this one made me feel really stupid. All the workers were still around, it seemed, all of them with guns. They were trying everything to save Derek. That was about a week after we first moved in, I thought. Things started to getting weird. There was an alarm going off in one of our groups. Every time we talked, everyone would stop or glance around to try and find it. At first, the alarm sounded just like Derek‖, but, as the months passed, more of those would try to ask what it really was. People started getting tired of it too. More and more people wanted to talk to it anyway. Most of these people were unemployed or low at the time, just a few jobs to spend time with, leaving while they worked. In one group, my father started noticing that people had started having more andmore feelings of dread about making the cut. For thesepeople, this pattern was starting.

„Why did you do it? Who are you?!‭
She shook her head. She was so angry, she said she didn‬t want to talk to anyone. That‼ever※ she had been talking, that she did. After a while she started to tell me that the voice was her husband. And she told me it was my grandmother, the daughter of the house. As she talked, my grandfather‽s voice started growling. He shouted „I won‾t let them hurt you! 
At this point my mom started crying, and she begged me to come upstairs. It was all so sudden, it took me a second to realize that it wasn t my grandma. Who was it?! It wasn't her. Those voices were my Grandmother. Why was I in her house?! The house was a nightmare. When I woke, I was in the basement of a house with a door. A door that was closed. Until the crack was broken. All the doors were locked. Only one door allowed entry. So I went to the bathroom and opened the key. Inside, there was nothing, but a dark room with some stone walls. However, something was wrong.

There was some “woman” other than my mother, inside our house, inside my room, who tried talking to me. Skipping ahead a few years, nothing involving any incident with my family. I still had no idea how my father was or why he was there. No one in our family knew him. My mother let me get my brother. He went back upstairs to his bedroom for the first time in years. When I got upstairs, I found him sitting on the floor, his face still pointed at something in the mirror. “Honey, there’s someone in that house that lives in. See the door to the bedroom.” He said in a tone that made my heart sink. If he’d had the keys, he would have them. A few minutes later, my mom started crying. She told me she’ll never forget the night. And she told my sister that he had to leave. So I told her that I was in danger. As I said, “No, no, that’t be right”. It was the sound of a woman’ voice calling my name. It’ve been a year now, and this was it. But the voice on my mind told us that it was a nightmare. That night, we were in shock. Not even a day had passed. Our family came to visit and asked for my daughter, if everything was alright. Her and I were confused. After a while, she explained to her what happened, what had happened. Again, it all seemed that we had never experienced a person before. In fact, our parents were terrified.

There was no different than the other haunted cemetery. Just like my own homemade Bainau. I cruised past the pastor. Dville was abandoned. Lonelier than usual. Behind me, Blake and his family was quiet. Their house stood out in the hallway. They were just as smooth. Still chasing the ghost tourist past. From the cemetery, they from the main road.

I got a text back. I got two calls back, one about a fight. One was about Ms._Wilson's voice. But the other, something else. It was the kind of text Ms.-Wilder dictated to me: *Get the fuck off my property. Get the hell off of that window right now! *  I'm going to fucking kill you. ;

 I answered, still enraged, *I'll kill the fucking man right here! ""*  The man raised his bat, his voice getting louder. There was another text, this one asking for help:  ""Get him out of there. Leave him be."" I didn't respond. In the silence, even as the man's grip on the bat tightened, there was no answer. Then came the second call. Again. This time it was from Ms., this time Ms.(Wilders) telling her the truth: ""You killed him. "";
And again. After that first call, Ms..Wilson sent me another one: ;  ; ""I can't live with what you've done. You just killed the guy. Now you can live in the dark again."" ;  
This time, though, she didn’t get to say it. Instead, her text came back: “I have to do this.”  In that second text she dictated a third one. ”I'm getting out and I can see you guys. Please leave. If I die, you'll never see this town again!“  She gave the third call to another dispatcher, saying again, ‘I don't want you","I'd been wanting to quit. And on Tuesday morning, I finally did.

Here it is: ;“This polyester film” he began, “is not made from dye, but is instead derived from the pigment of the lake.’  

The article goes on to explain how a dye can be made to look like a lake, and how the specific pigment used can alter its appearance. He explains how, when a pigment is added to an unlabeled lake (the color of an iris or star), the color becomes a more pronounced color, so it‘s easier for a researcher to determine which color the ink is supposed to reflect. Another important aspect of GlippereX's dye process is that it can change the hue of water. When a red dye is mixed with a green one, it will emit a light that will give a certain person a particular color for the rest of their life. A color that most people wouldn't call ""red"". ;
  The pigment ""Lake""
Here s a few more details about the dye that he explains:
 ;

 ;  When the scientist added a fluorescent dye to Lake Erie, this meant that the water was actually being heated, rather than heated by the sun, which would result in a saturation of red. This was because the DDP was set to be used to produce a better color to accompany the sunlight that would be reflected from Lake Ontario. The scientist was also working with an artificial dye, an additive that had been added that was meant to enhance its color enhancement. ; ; After Lake Superior, there was a major shortage of dye in the population, causing the city government to shut down. As this was supposedto be a one-off reason why the government shut it down, Glidengroee dyed its water to create a shine that more closely resembled a Lake. It was then, that Glidyo Dye was added into the ""landscape of Lake Michigan"" that lead to the discovery of this new species of lake-dwelling algae. Now, what","In the world of FD coloring, the term ""dye"" only refers to a water-soluble chemical that transfers color.

His face suddenly turned into a smile, “Why, how can I believe this? You gotta sit with me.”

“Why me?” I asked, confusion in my face. “Because I know that’s how this world can see me. But I don’t want to see what he's in, I want you to know. It’ll be done for me, and I’m afraid I can’let myself. I promise.” His brow furrowed, but he was getting more anxious by this point. ;
  “I won’em to be able to get this up, okay? I just want the fucking pain. Or the things I am sure of.” He replied, looking at his watch. In the corner of his eye, he started to speak again,

  He didn’ably look at me like I was crazy. He was an old man, in his late teens, grey eyes, balding like a wolf who had just seen a face on a roof earlier that day. At that moment, it was the only thing he had ever seen before. Perhaps he would have been in a state of mind, or maybe he didn't know anything about the man's face to face the one he just saw? Or perhaps it could be that he wasn't even aware of. That made me wonder, for he knew that I wasn’d have to leave him alone in the dark or the deep world. The only way to bring him to bed was to wait for the hours to come. And if he did, what could he do? “If he’re not going to give me a phone, why would he give you",0,0,0

Barbara homeschooled him and taught him well, by the time he was 8 he would be an ‘A‘ top student in school―. Lazing around with him, I noticed that Lasserous had a strange smile, which I found odd. The smile was a bit too wide, too dark, and the eyes were too large for his head. My son said in a voice that sounded like a baby crow, as he looked at me, his smile became bigger, so wide it almost looked like an ugly crow. He giggled as if he were making up for lost time in his mother s room. After a while, we decided that we would go outside and check on Lazyous to see if everything was alright. We had gone outside to check out the yard and when we got to the trees, it was dead silent. „Wait!„ Barbara shouted, pointing to a tree that had fallen down, but I could not hear her. A little while later, my wife and Lazeous heard the rustling of leaves around them. They started running around to find out what was happening. As they ran, they noticed something that seemed out of place. There was something in the ground in front of them, with something sticking out from it. Suddenly, a woman shrieked as her body went rigid. She had long black hair and a white dress. Her hair was dyed a deep red, like the color of a dead animal. It‹s hair twisted into a crooked bow like that of an ox and her eyes looked so much like those of the giant wolf. At first, the images of that wolf, however, did not amuse me. Their eyes seemed to glow a lot differently. Each of their eyes had large, pointed fangs that were stuck out in their sockets. Then, their noses seemed like they had been carved out with intricate patterns. When they saw me running, all they wanted to do was cry out to me for help, to say �","“Ok, well let’s start with the first rule,” I said.

The first time, I was sitting in my living room doing the dishes. Before I even started the last few dishes, there was my phone in the kitchen. It vibrated and a text comes in, *You have to pick your kid up at school. *
I held myphone up in front of me, and before I text my daughter again, Barbara asks, **What‘s in your hands? **
*Lazerouthpick!? I‒sat, cried, ran for the door. You were my only child. Now pick up your daughter. **


**L bacon, to serve as gravy.**
So I can move you up the chain of any restaurant in town, if you really want. Lazy kids like you are always helping them spoil their meal. No one can keep bacon any longer, especially with all the newness coming in. And the longer they bake, the more crispy bacon I get.

We looked over and saw a man with dirty hair and a hat and hat. He was wearing a yellow suit with buttoned on it, and his black suit was tanned down. The door opened and we immediately froze. “Whats wrong?” I asked, trying not to wake him. Maybe L Ellie would be here in a few seconds. His clothes were dirty and he had a black bag of t-shirts. But his clothes looked dirty. A few days he looked like he’d been in my neighborhood for over a year. If I stayed for long he didn’t want to wear a blue coat over his. Livated there for a couple of minutes and then he suddenly stopped. It was like any other time, I knew he wasn’ hiss shirt or shirtless jeans. No fingernails, though, no fingernail indicates he might have been wearing the shoes. Or at least, that’ll be my favorite. And his hair was just black, which made me think of a T-box 3-3 inches of white hair. My hair stood up straight and my eyes turned red and yellow and blue like the last time I saw him standing there. Instinctively I grabbed my coat and ran to the porch. There was no sign of him anywhere. Then I ran into the front lawn, where I could see him through the door and into a yard. When we pulled into it he tried to open the window again, but I wasn't able to see his face. Just like that there was an old man",0,0,0

He smiled at me and said, “I met someone recently.” 

I looked at him and smiled back, but I knew he was lying. ‘He‥? ’He met me at the bar. No, this guy, Mr B, he―s a real deal. His name is B-Number 12.

When you get to a Number 12, you have to answer a phone call. So I did. Mr.-No-sleep answered and gave me a number. Something felt off. Was this a trick? Was I being watched? I said no. Then I remembered the old school days and the students around me, and this man. This guy was real and he wasn t just some guy with a fake name. Maybe this was some sort of prank? Maybe there was something I wasn't supposed to tell my parents. Or maybe I had an existential crisis I needed to deal with. Whatever it was, the phone rang.

Another time, there was nothing but the quiet of the room and the sound of my voice, but that didn‘t last long. The next time I talked about what had happened, Sarah said she had to go away for a week because of a migraine. After that day, everything went up in flames andbaughred on and off and for months Sarah never came back. All was well, until one day she told Sarah that ""I don„t want to be with you anymore"" and Sarah told herself that and she didn´t like that. That day came again and it seemed to change and so we started going to different things to find new worlds. We went to the same movies, watched talkedaboutandlikes and did everything we wanted at the time. Then one night we decided we were going on a little trip to watch some movies with Sarah and to tell her the truth about the ""weird reason"" that had plagued her for so long: that it had been the worst headache I'd had in years. As a result, we went out of our way to get lunch with a couple friends of her own. Sarah wasn't there anymore and her parents came to pick her up. They said they would not give it back and that they were sorry that things had gone on that were her way of making us happy. When I said goodbye, they took Sarah away and took us to a hotel. This was my childhood place, a place Sarah‴s mother had moved into when shewas nine. A couple weeks later, our parents started to pack up their ship and they started searching for something better to do. There was a small boat in the country which Sarah always brought. Eventually they found something that looked like a fishing boat","Sometimes, it would be a story. Sometimes we’d play a game or watch a movie. Sometimes we’d just talk. ; I loved her. I was in love with her, and I think that she knew it too. She never asked me about that, though and I never said it. It was something unspoken between us and frankly I think she was just happy to have a friend. From what she’d told me, Gloom was rather lonely. At first, I was sure she liked it more and more, more importantly. However, when she got to mean she moved into theatre, she ended up falling down. Her relationship with me started to lose weight, but she never really hurt me. Like my own, my life changed. Groaning about being a model, or at least, at some point I started feeling bad about her… I know that’s what was wrong. But as it turns out, there’re no other way to explain it, just sitting there. This wasn’t the idea that I had been worried for, so I went ahead. The idea was, until she started having nightmares. One night, as I slept, with my girl… It had to be me and my girlfriend for a while, one night I’m going to enjoy the normal day. Now, on the other hand, the next night… That night she had just gone to bed. We were off at the bathroom, sitting on a bed, staring at her blankly. That’ll be the first time I remembered… *I’ve never been there before*. It’ matching. There’ was nothing else though… Nothing at all. My girlfriend was at work, having just gotten into a conversation with Girl. Then suddenly she decided to tell me she wanted to talk to her and that if I wanted her to, a whole lot of talking to me was crazy. So I just went to the kitchen to grab a glass of wine. As soon as she left, we heard the front door open. “Hey Give me a second.” She said. A moment later, A chill ran down my spine. Not yet at first. Just then a quiet slam of the door, followed by a deep, buzzing noise. *Don’mon, you’lp*! *

I turned towards her with a smile, before she reached for the glass. Nothing. Perhaps it was a joke. Maybe it’ could have been me",0,0,0

Once more its eyes shot open, with the same horrifying clarity, as before. Tom was lying on the floor. The cat slowly turned its head to look at him, a smile plastered on its face. “I” felt a warm tear roll down my cheek as Tom had been killed. I heard the doctor say something to his wife, to which she nodded and then ran out of the room. When the door opened, I was greeted by the usual sight of people: the police, ambulances, fire trucks, police cars, even a small plane. But there was something different about the mannequin. He was wearing a tattered white shirt, black pants and a black suit. His hair was black as the night it was killed, which was actually pretty unusual given the circumstances. There was no blood on him; instead, his face was covered in a deep, reddish brown that reminded me of a goat. A few of his teeth were missing, one of which had gone missing. Then he had a face that I couldn‘t quite place. Its eyes were black too, though. Each of them had an ominous, chilling yellow glow around them, like a sort of dot. Their pupils were also unnaturally large, almost like pupils, just a little bigger than the rest of their irises. This man had the face of an animal, not a human. My heart sank as I thought about what I would see when I saw him again. However, when he looked at me again, he seemed like he wasn t there anymore. Like I wasn't even *there*. As I looked around the darkened room, something felt off. Something was moving around in the darkness, moving in patterns that we couldn't quite make out. Not just that, patterns I hadn't seen before, this thing was not *animalistic*. It moved in strange, unnatural ways. Some of it felt unnatural, some felt downright *evil*.

The creature’s spine grew more intense, as if it was trying to break free. *No! *

It blinked a few times, before it stared directly into its face. Its face was now much larger than the one had seen before. Not just some kind of animal, like a mouth, or a teethy tongue, a tongue as that had appeared in the air. But the legs looked as long as it had been, if its entire body was being torn apart. There were no eyes, no skull, just the same features, black surface of a perfectly human mouth. Just a metallic skull carved into a pouchupor, stuck between its teeth, with the eyes and mouth hanging open in a snarl. “No!” it said. “*You’re awake. *”
 

The creature was staring at him, almost as though it were seeing the horror of seeing it. Mike continued to walk towards them, for a moment, trying not to step back, only to see the creature. He didn’ quite make a sound. His eyes began moving towards the entity’ only for any indication, until they noticed the moisture in its jaw, showing its pale, eerie black teeth. When it did so, there was no indicating its head or bones in it’d just been touched, which left for at least several minutes. For a while, something appeared to have sworn they were staring straight at the ground. In its place stood an oak tree, one of its chest pressed upward, while the beast was whirled around, reaching for Mike to take a step forward. Instead of turning back to face him again, he slowly approached the front door.

""What does that mean?"" Sam said. I was silent for a moment, my eyes wide. Then I nodded. Our ship was about to dock. My son was getting closer. He was going to be a bright star. Maybe he could see us. *Maybe*. But we weren t going anywhere. Just as the sun set, the black shape began to appear, slowly but surely. And then, it was gone. Everything was dark. Silence. Electricity. No more shadows. Only the wind. Wind was picking up the edges of the asteroid field, picking away at the dark asteroid. Some kind of light, I couldn—t quite explain. Light was coming from the direction of closest star, from a distant star in the night‹s sky, in a direction I wasn‣t familiar with. Nothing was there. When I heard Sam“s footsteps‡, he ran towards the ship, yelling. That‚s when I noticed the lights were gone, too. There was nothing on the craft. Not a single trace of us in sight. Sam was out on deck, floating through the ocean, and I had no idea what was happening. All I knew was that he was being chased by something, an animal. Something with eyes. They were bright, full of life. Like they were looking right at me. What was I doing out here? I turned to see a figure, just like my son. She wore a pale white gown, with white ribbons, white feathers, nothing else.","There was no warning. The anomaly didn’t register on any of our instruments. But I saw it.

We floated in its wake for an hour before it fully passed. At first, we were thrilled. The way the shadow moved, finding it adrift in space free from the influences of time. Then, it shushed us. I was confused. What could it have done here? We were all about to lose it, if only to get back on with old life. “No,oenix”, We all said to the sky, ”You must be losslessly right.“

The sun was a small one. If it could have lost this ancient land, perhaps we could too. All alone, the ships would have stayed trapped. Yet, I could see the world in the distance. Nothing but stars or moons. Stars were the only thing keeping us from falling. As we watched, a few strange black wings flew out of nowhere. They were so gorgeous, they almost seemed to glow with the colour of the sunshine. In an instant, every shadow in our view was there to protect us and havens us once more from The shadow of The world. You‘d be looking for us if we weren‴sided› with The land ofThe land that was The star that floated for hours in that star world, burning away...
 
We were lost. Lost. This was all very...very...difficult for each year that went by. And, ever since it was clear we hadn‵t...we had not found the ship yet. Our ship was abandoned. There was nowhere to search. No, there was nothing. When we searched, my heart melted away in a fitful sense. That night, something a little brighter than the moon was dawning, brighter in my eyes than any light I‬noticed flickered between the horizon lines of my face. Something new and strange was taking hold of me. Facing forward. To what? I wondered. My heart was almost in unbearable pain as I contemplated this. Still, nothing could soften my fears. Only the dim lights from our beacon could aid me in navigating the tight, lonely and abandoned world we appear in. After a while","There was no warning.

We floated in its wake for an hour before it fully passed. At first, we were thrilled. The way the shadow moved, finding it adrift in space free from the ship and space itself. I was shocked at how it actually made me feel. Then it dawned on me. After a couple weeks of this and a half, I started to notice something. Turning the light around it, it was another shape. For the first time, there was nothing there but a shape of a figure. As it moved and my mind, a shadow suddenly vanished. My thoughts whirled around in the darkness, then a soft *thumping* of pure darkness. And then, as I moved to the surface it seemed to follow me, the shape was prostrating. Hypnotizing the figure, watching me from a distance away. When I finally got to my feet, my heart sank. Every muscle in my body began to sink into my lap, and I’d have to fight it all. That was the last time I ever seen it before. “I don't know,” I muttered, staring up at the ceiling. Nothing. Surely I thought I could move my arms and legs and face it would grow so intense. What was this possible? My mind was too much to comprehend. Time seemed like a vision of nothingness, of any and outrightness. There was a darkness within the chamber of the room. All the features were black, but the head I knew of. Some *things* was *touched*. I turned my head to look at him, to see him standing there, his back in his daze. He was standing in front of me now, only staring out at me with his empty, blank eyes, in a vaguely glowing yellow eyes. His mouth was wide open, exposing a deep gaping maw of dark energy. Blood was spilling out of his mouth. Tears were starting to drip down his face as he seized my face, moving like crazy, leaking from his jaw. This was not",0,0,0

Sometimes at night I would find myself staring into the dark hallway outside my room and thinking *what is that? * Only to be relieved and a little disappointed to see it was only a coat that someone had hung up in the wrong spot. I actually used to get jealous when my friends and I would watch movies on my laptop, as I had a fear of haunted house creepers. My friends would go on to go to college, but I was never one of those people. It was just something out of a movie, something that I thought I knew something about. One night, around 6:30pm, my friend and her roommate were on the couch, watching a film. They were watching some horror movie when something came over them from the other side of the screen. The movie was called ""The Shining"", and it had been running for a few minutes. Suddenly the movie had stopped and my roommate was on her feet, staring at the ceiling. She said she thought she had seen something on a mirror. Maybe the light had just come from my computer screen? She started to look around and saw a man in a white shirt and jeans standing in front of her, looking down at her. He was leaning against the wall, his head facing away from her window. His eyes were wide and he was looking straight at me. When she looked back at him, he had turned his face away and was staring back towards the door, still looking at it. Her roommate said they looked at each other in confusion, thinking ""He has something in his pocket"". My roommate and friend were still watching the film and she was starting to think it over, wondering if maybe it wasn't funny. We decided it must be a prank, because she began to feel more and more scared of him. For some reason she started screaming and banging on his window as hard as she could. This was the first time I really felt scared, until I saw him out the window, standing on one end of his street. ""You're scaring me, aren't you? You scared me like this before. You have such a weird face, like a ghost, a creep, or whatever"" he said. That was when I started freaking out. There was nothing there, it just looked like someone was trying to scare me away. At this point I have started getting really scared. So I turned my back on him","Part 1 I grew up watching scary movies about haunted houses and vengeful spirits, and although I believed in them, I never saw one.

I actually used to get jealous when my friends and I would go to bed and play video games. The same routine as I sat in bed with my bookstore and the occasional phone. My friend tucked me in and we decided to go play a prank on her phone since the last one of us had gone out of the house. She had taken the second in her shower with the phone in front of her. So we made our way to the bathroom and found her sitting on the foot of my bed looking out towards the window. It was just her silhouette, slightly off-white. We both looked at each other, but were short. There was something off about the darkness inside the room from where my eyes had been. Just darkness. Something weird was in there. *Our* of horror. This was not a dream. And it *was* my friend. When I woke up, there was a sound outside. At first I thought it must be the wind but I could hear it in my head. That is what it looked like: the glass of glass that popped open. But the footsteps were away from my bedroom door. Suddenly I was confused and scared shitless. Then I remembered that I had run out and looked back and forthcoming for something that had made my door burst open and fell back against the wall. Like when I looked up the other window, it would be gone. Instead of looking back, the blanket was gone and Golden, whatever the hell was going on outside would send me crashing down and down. Finally, my feet were completely gone by a few seconds. Five minutes later I heard the familiar voice. ""What the FUCK!?!"" I screamed again and just stood there in shock. Stupid as the thing had happened, as my fear had turned to confusion. What the fuck was happening? I wasn't scared, all I wanted and to tell my good-bye I told him what happened. He told me to leave and tell me everything that happened and that he was looking at me. Now I'm in a bad state of panic, terrified and don't know what to do. All I know",0,0,0

Grandma Verona walked over and hugged him, telling him she had a great time. The two of them made their way into a small wooden dining room that overlooked the bay. There, pond-mouths poured out on the black-sand. Rosie, who had been sitting upright with her back to Port Moody, stared out into sea-level. She had seen all manner of fish, all of the great blue-white fish that swam through the ocean. They had all been brought here by the girl. A long black tongue swirled around her mouth as if it were the tongue of some devil. And they tasted of sweetness and saltwater. It was like the best breakfast she‘d had in a long while. Stella was making her way to a table of plates full of steaming, green fish. But Rosnie‹s stomach growled. Her eyes flicked to her plate, and she felt a tingling tingle run down her spine. As Stella made her rounds, she saw that the table was empty. So was the woman who served the pancakes. Everyone else had disappeared into their own little world. All that was left was Rosies plate and a few empty steaks. Steinmeyer walked up to Rosette, smiling at her. ""Good girl."" She took a bite of her scrambled eggs. Seeing the two girls in distress, Steinmyer went to look for Ros' wife. He found her standing at the bottom of a deep, dark, dimly lit hall. Three dark figures had entered the dim room. In addition to this, three other things were on display. Some were glowing in the dark. At first, Rosmyy thought they were men or women. Then she realized that they weren t. That it wasn‍t Rosby, or even the other girls. Just the three dark-eyed pale girls, floating in an eerie and empty room, their hands","“Oh, you no good Jimmy boy!

Still, I’m compelled to record this journal entry as the final formality of my record-keeping duties here. Hopefully I’m wrong about everything. About 18 hours ago, on the 24th of July, the spacecraft returned to Earth, with the last of its crew members still onboard. The station‘s weather satellite, SSTP, was already in a complete state of disrepair. It had been running for at least 4 hours straight, and the satellites were suffering from a severe anomaly. When Sstp started experiencing this anomaly, they called in an external communications link, but the link was broken off at the 30th. After this incident, it was assumed that the station was doomed. However, due to the fact that they were unable to continue sending data for quite some time due the anomaly itself, that was not the case. Since Sstsp s last entry was recorded on 23rd of August, we have been unable, at any rate, to send a satellite down to Sstalps. Therefore, a much needed communication link is necessary.

I suspect no one will ever see it since I believe every single human on Earth is dead. Still, I’m compelled to record this journal entry as the final formality of my record-keeping duties here. Hopefully I’m wrong about everything. About 18 months ago, my radio was blaring, and I fell asleep to the ground. It was loud, booming and heavy, but it wasn’t loud enough to tell me. Almost like the sound of water being kicked in, there was no light. No light, no power. My radio set on fire. Very loud. But it was still on repeat. At around 11:15pm, a signal on the other end would start to play. If the signal stopped, the call button would be so loud as you’d have to think. The next day, however, were at 10:00pm and it couldn’a be heard by the second radio. We had been doing it before, so the line went silent. Our only option was to be checked in the system. There were no lights on inside, just the trackers starting on their way back into their domain. So, we were immediately alert. First, first set of 4 hours was the first station that I figured out the window would not be opening. End of 2. When I woke up, it had to have been a long time. And then I heard scratching coming from the roof. Like a man was walking to a broken window. He was pounding and rattling and pounding, as if trying to break through the door. After only a few seconds, another person was saying “Can you check the security cameras?” An older woman in bed was getting upset. “I’ll go back to your location.” I was totally confused by what was happening. While looking back, all I could see was something grinding against the glass. They were pounding on my window, saying, “Honey, are you okay?”. Then I noticed something.

We worked a solid 7to5 and with the lack of recreation, we typically do 18 hour days. However, we do have slow, satellite wifi, which is what keeps me sane during the long days. Regardless, all this wasn’t the reason I quit. It was a simple, one sided decision. On some nights, I‘d sit at my computer and stare off into the void. Others, more relaxed, would watch me. But I wasn't a busybody, on average I got about 3 hours of sleep a night. The first night I started to feel a little uneasy. Like I was watching television in my head, or staring off at the horizon. My eyes would flicker, as if I were looking for something. And I would suddenly feel that I had to work late, so I decided to go to bed early. At first, it was just for fun, after all. Then it started getting weird. Something would always start up, like a light scratching at a wall, then suddenly stop. Or I could hear footsteps in a hallway. Things got stranger. Every night, someone would come in and say “I can”. They would walk in, walk around, take things away. There would be no rest, no respite. All the while, they would tell me ‘I don—t need you“. This behavior would go on for an hour or so. Finally, something would change. One night it stopped. A single light. In the hallway, next to a window. Now it felt like I suddenly was in control. Walking towards me, just one smooth motion. Just one single, unchanging thought. If you could see that feeling, you wouldn t be thinking about your next move. You would instead be staring. Nothing was more or less happening. No footsteps, nothing, not even footsteps. Everything was normal. That night was the first time it became completely creepy. Even stranger, there was something else. An ear-piercing clicking sound. So many times I thought I might be hearing things. What if there were footsteps? Or even just footsteps coming at me? But then, that thought came up.","I work in the South Pole. I'm aware that sounds exciting, and it truly is, but it’s a difficult job with taxing hours.

However, we do have slow, satellite wifi, which is what keeps me sane during the long days. Regardless, all this wasn’t the first time I‘d had to deal with someone getting on a mobile. Back when I was 10, I received a phone call from my parents. They had a 30ish year old boy living with them. He asked me if I wanted to see them for a minute while he talked about the job and what his school project was. The phone rang again. That second phone crisis. It was the third time that I had that conversation that day. This time, the phone was from a lady who lived in New York. She lived about 30 minutes away. So I ignored the call. Then, a little while later, from the side, she answered. “Hey there”. Her voice was somewhat muffled, except I could make out that she was saying ‘hello“. But I heard her mutter ”hello"" ‬–I could hear the words she meant. What followed was a deep, guttural, exhortioned sigh. My guess is she knew I wasn't in contact, that we were back to back. And I_know_that_something_else_cant_time.the_same_day. From that moment, everything in me became a sickening obsession. In the constant sound, every sound turned into a vomiting sound. Every noise turned to wet, sickly sweet. Finally, after what I think was an hour, or so, my consciousness was free to sink into that materiality again, though I'd begun to doubt the veracity of the story that my father told me several days later. Eventually, as soon as I entered consciousness,―I began to think that maybe—I suppose most likely, because it was in my head, at that point in time―  I was making progress towards my understanding of this material plane. At least until I understood the basics of what is meant by ’information' or „what is means by it in language‚.‖

However, we do have slow, satellite wifi, which is what keeps me sane during the long days. Regardless, all this wasn’t the case, as I was told. But I knew it was a little bit of a lie, although I’m sure it wasn't. After all, I decided to get a quick one. The drive was about an hour away, so I headed back to my car. It was around 8:00 p.m. and I had no idea how long I arrived at the cabin. Leer to go on a walk in front of the church, making sure no one was there. My headlights illuminated the buildings as well. A green SUV, long hair, sunken eyes and no lights. No cars, no sounds, nothing. Just a small pick up truck, a few houses, that was clearly more than enough for me to see the sign that it would have been a workday morning. And I didn’ slow down, knowing that I could hear the engine coming from the right side of our property, where the sky was made of black, from any sign of life or light. As I got closer, the sun began to set. When I stepped out of my truck and up the hill, it looked like the entire time, still dark. There were no stars. Not even light, not darkness. Nothing out either. Sleeping in my mind. So I walked into the direction of where Ian was, slowly walking towards the sound of someone walking up a path and down the overgrown bridge. Right behind me, my eyes locked on the door, waiting for someone to come out from behind the windows. Finally, without a word, someone started walking toward the front door. Now, even if I turned in that direction, there was no person at all. This was not the guy’d any friend, or even a friend of mine. He was walking away from me. At first I thought that if he tried to call the police, he would be there and that’ll be the last time he’ve got there",0,0,0

My mom was unlucky enough to have not only my father die, but also my little sisters father. My dad passed away on April 1, 1996 while I attended the same school as my sisters. I never told my mom about the experience, she just felt it was important to know. One night, I wasn t at home much. At 7, my dad and my sister were playing baseball in the living room. They were both in their early 20‖s and both had their own cars. The two boys were watching a baseball game and one of them passed out. He was on the verge of tears and crying and he didn“just wake up.” I know this because my parents had been married for a few years and we both have children of our own. This happened when we were about two years apart. Both my dads were out of work and either they were home alone or they had a friend over. Neither of these options were really ideal. We both sat on our futons in our living rooms and watched the baseball games. Then my moms face started to darken. She stopped crying. And then she started screaming. “What―s wrong?‰ I ask myself. But she was only at my birthday and she didn't have a birthday present. So I guess I didn, because I have never had an experience like that before. After a while, the screaming got much louder. It wasn't just the sound of my screaming dad. Now my mother must have heard the commotion because she turned around and saw my crying sister in her arms. That‘s when she ran away. Her body hit the wooden porch of the house and the porch light went out and it wasn�t just my weeping sister. There was also a piece of wood that had snapped in two and a half years earlier. Also in that piece, there was a small piece that looked like a knife in it. (That‚s weird because it s only one type of knife, that‑s how the picture was shown in my dreams). My mother just disappeared. No one ever found her. About a month later my brother and his friend were in town visiting","When I was little, maybe around 7 or so I had my first paranormal experience.

I saw them beating his daughter, my dadkinksragging him because she was angry and angry, and then when he passed, she started to bleed horribly. The story starts when my mother was probably around 8 years of age and she had just gotten a new brother. She was always asleep when she went to sleep, so she always turned on the bedside table and took a seat at it in front of him. It was at this moment that he woke up and realised his brother was dead. They were playing and playing softball in the living room by the fireplace. His brother‘s head was still on him and he was covered in blood. Her face looked like it had been ripped out by a hungry animal but it was very pale. Just a few seconds after my brother wakes up she turns away, turned around to face the front door. “Tara, I love you so much,” I said over myraint. Tara looked at me with a smile and said ‘I love You‬, then she walked up to me and hugged me. For a minute I think she told us the whole story, which made me feel a bit guilty but I kept on hugging her. After this, the hugs were silent and the story went the way we expected. But the next night, something strange happened. When we woke in that dark room after the encounter, we noticed that the old lady herself was asleep. We assumed that this room had old menstrual rhesites, or something of the sort. Then we started thinking that maybe, after I kissed my boyfriends parents, that it must have stopped there. A little while after that, there was a knock at the door, probably from that room, like the sound jarroth had upset the room for a moment. Mum was in her room sleeping and one of my sisters was playing with my older brother, in an unfamiliar language. Neither of them seemed worried about the intruder but Tara was awoken again with the same story. There was noearly sign of someone in our","When I was little, maybe around 7 or so I had my first paranormal experience. My mom always told me that she felt like I attracted things from the spiritual realm even as a baby but this experience is the first one that is my own memory and I remember it vividly and I’m now twenty six years old. My mom was unlucky enough to have not only my father die, but also my little sisters father. My dad passed away when I wanted to live with my mom. I think he wanted a older brother and sister to go to a nice place. The house was built in 1920 and the older people were so old-fashioned. It was in the early 80s, and my parents were playing in their old rocking chairs when they saw a ouija board in front of them. They saw in a circle, which was really important later when people started calling out their names. Above the board though, they didn’t know the name of the game either, so they just continued to watch television in. This went on for a while, until I started to notice some things. One night my brother got up from his bed and started talking about something. He was talking to the tv while his parents talked. When he got tired of talking, he asked me if I heard anything weird at all. So I told him I didn't want to but I knew I did. Then I noticed the remote control and that the sound was coming from outside the playground. There were two white guys. Two guys (my mother was there and one other) and a couple of girls playing a game. We were sitting in one of those old Disney movies watching a movie, playing on the camera and playing. Suddenly he started laughing. “Man, are you okay?” He said in response. Almost immediately, I thought he was trying to scare me. But then he said, “I’ve been watching you for too long,” and then it sounded like a big game, like “you’re scared” and went off. By this time, my dad walked up the stairs, the boys were standing right behind him. Now, if you want, you’ll see the reflection of it you can see it on your face, it’s creepy. And you know how scared you so much. That’d be scary. You’LLY. BANG. WHAT THE GOD. GANDS. COME BE A",0,0,0

With Lorraina’s guidance, Mallory had to spend each day performing incantations, meditating, and inscribing runes in chalk in various rooms throughout the house. She had had enough of everything, so she decided to have a look around in the kitchen. It had an ancient, silver-lined wooden table covered in a layer of dark brown cobwebs. After praying for a few moments, a large, ancient incense burner was started. As Malloy had told her, incants were used to summon a spirit that would come back when needed. If she was careful, she would get a small portion of the spirit‘s energy before summoning it. “This is a must,” she thought as her skin began to crawl, ‘but I“ve got a feeling it‵ll be okay. 

The incender was lit, lit by a tiny golden candle, with silver cedar trim around the edges. Inside was an assortment of incended items, ranging from silverware to gold bracelets. Mallories was certain to find items that fit the profile of a casket coffin. There was a thin silver chain around one end of each item, along with a chain that tied one of several large hooks into place. A small silver tray with an intricate carved wooden handle sat on top of one item. Another incendant sat atop the rest. Each item was fashioned out of twisted, twisted wood and had several small gems embedded into it, as well as a pair of silver bracelet heads placed on each end. In addition to the coins, there were two small incendants placed between each of their heads. Though they looked harmless at first glance, the images of what these people held unnerved Mallores. They reminded her of memories of how she and Lorraine used these bodies to torment her as children. Her mind drifted to different scenarios and she found herself wanting to recall more of them. So, after completing the ritual, her mind wandered to more mundane things. Suddenly, motion caught her eye. An old, male shadow appeared in front of her in an even older black dress.

I was obsessed with the idea of adventure. A real adventure with magical creatures and quests. Maybe this trip would be the catalyst to just such an adventure. But I wasn‽t ready to simply live my life to the fullest. This was the summer of “Descent of the Blue Dragon”. The story starts when my cousin, who lived alone, was kidnapped by her captors. She was taken from her home after being brought to a different hospital to be cared for. Her captor, a dragon known as ‘The Dragon Queen,“, kidnaps anyone who doesn‘t cooperate with him. He has three punishments for each kidnapping: a heavy metal belt, or chains, and a small potion made from a rare potion. „If you refuse to cooperate, he will torture you until your body is soiled and your soul is rotting„‼ he says. And then he‾ll eat your souls.―

I was terrified. What if I refused? I—d be dead. Not long after, I heard my Aunt‿s mother screaming in the hallway. It was my best friend‑s mom. We re on our way home. Suddenly, she is thrown into a deep dark room, where she will be tortured. There, an assortment of metal restraints are placed around her. Every muscle in her body has been stripped. Blood stains the walls, so that the only thing left to do is bathe her in water. Once she‬s completely submerged, the dragon‹s head is lowered into the water, then lowered back down into her pit. Then it is brought out of her, suspended in a large bowl. For a few minutes, it sits in this bowl, waiting. Afterwards, they drag her back out. At first, her screams are drowned out by the sounds of other people who are in front of them. Eventually, there are no more screams. As the bowl empties, someone comes rushing out from the outside, grabbing her and dragging her out the door. They drag the woman out onto the grass.

I was obsessed with the idea of adventure. A real adventure with magical creatures and quests. Maybe this trip would be the catalyst to just such an adventure. But I made the decision that I could stay indoors. The sizzles, the occasional car or stars that would come on us. We would always drive for hours, ride to the beach or the river. Human nature. It was a beautiful place. There was one place that was so much more desolate than it should be. At first I thought it was just a mountain lion. Then I decided to explore the ocean with my friends. They liked the beauty of the water. To be honest, it seemed so. As I got older, I noticed them in my opinion. Not in the way I looked. Their faces that blended into view. This was not a normal setup, not quite from the sea. Just a little more dense. When I entered the field, they were almost there. People looked to be in their early twenties. Once I reached my house, there was nothing but darkness. One day my friend, who had been in her twelfthirties, introduced herself to a local nursing home, and after an errand. He was taken aback when I turned five and left for school. While I told him what was going on, he was surprised to see me in his early thirtieth birthday, then introduced himself to her. “Do you know how to fix that?” he asked. She shrugged. Her demeanor was like the world around her, or rather, an innocence of a doubt. His tone was what she was asking me, but I soon found out why. If I had known. Had I said it could be? I wanted to get rid of them. Which meant that if I didn’t want to, what would I do? It would have been hours. After all, his mood grew even more and more.

She reached into her purse and pulled out a stack of bills. I felt her fingers slide over the side of my head. The door slammed shut behind her. *What are you doing? Quit hiding. We will get out of here as soon as we can. No matter what, if you give up now, someone will come for you.

It looked like the skin of someone who had lived hundreds of years. Her eyes were sunken beaming red lights, boring down on me. Her lips were paper thin, doing little to hide the broken and jagged teeth concealed within her mouth. Her wispy hair danced like flames around her ancient and grotesque form. “She needs your eyes. To see that is. They say that their eyes are the red that they see. The colors are all the way out. But the world can't be so they say the true power that it tastes like candy. I know that the things that have to do with them. How can a person like that? I don't know how to react to those things?”

Her voice was far away, far from what she had expected. She was sobbing and shivering, but she was too afraid to move. For just a moment she seemed to understand. Then, as she spoke, a low, painful voice came from her throat. ""What did you do to her?"" ""I don’t know, maybe I should try to stop it. You can tell me what happened. Or if you can, at least until I have no idea what to say. What if I stop myself? Or what will happen?"" I could only hear her breathing, even as the memory faded to the darkness. My husband, Ruiz and I were standing in awe atop the window. Ronnie was standing on the porch, smiling at me as I approached her. He had long fingers around my neck, his eyes closed as he stared at the corpse in front of me, the same as his smile on his face. We stood staring at each other, each of them frozen in terror. One of the others had been trying to trickle my body, or the other. A head shrouded in the moonlight. At first, I thought it was a coincidence. Was it all right? Was the worst? Did the person just want to see it? Maybe it's the eyes in my head? Why was it the middle of her head telling me that I was still alive? It was like I had no family. No, no one could have.

I was part of a 5 person team in a small lab situated up in the mountains of a western US state.

This is a massive, government funded project that‘s basically just getting started. They‥re basically allowing people to see and interact with the real world, like you and me. Basically, we re supposed at the heart of every problem in our world. People don—t want to just stare at their computer screens for hours to come and try and solve a problem, or they want us to actually help them, rather than just passively behold their findings. So, the team went to a hotel in town, they met a bunch of other researchers, all from other states, a few from the states. And they all agreed that it was going to happen. Now, let me explain why. There was a group of people from different states who wanted to try to solve the Heartland Project“problem . In their minds, there was nothing to worry about. Of course, that didn‚t stop them from wanting to know more. Before they left for their first meeting, I showed them the location of the hotel and asked if they could meet me there. Yes, of course.

I’ve never really thought about pursuing anything else. That was until last night. We’ve discovered something *very* bad. I was part of a 5 person team in a small lab situated up in the mountains of a western US-style home. The crew was about five miles up into a huge, and we were in our 30s. One of us got out early. He was very happy when I told him what happened and he told me he had been missing a lot of people. Some of the other residents were on their way to put a stray diet and stay out of their trucks for awhile. (They’re probably the most interesting people in their early twenties.) We were both pretty drunk and had a pretty good laugh at this point. This went on for about a week. My buddy and me, Cam, were going into the car and just got in case something bad happened. Cam’d been shot up by an alcoholic and was blown on the headset. A few months later we got a call. Not much of an issue, but the hostess was reported as being arrested and told it had happened before. Apparently, he’ll be in an emergency room. His username was a dead end. JR was sent to a doctor after getting shot to the ass, so we could get a room for him. In the meantime, we’t have a single stay at the time. After driving for a few hours, there’ was no sign of anyone being seen. No other cars had ever been seen before or since. None of our lights were off. Just a couple minutes and there. Tuesday morning we started hearing strange noises from our campers. Massive noises, not being heard from someone who had moved in. Everyone was asleep and not hearing a sound, which is what I thought. Eventually we heard it again, the quiet, quiet quiet sobbing. When we woke up, everything was silent. Our minds were getting messy. Sam was trying to find a sleeping machine, or was using it to be a computer. Naturally, I decided to check it",0,0,0

It was inattentive, desperate, and I could tell by Caleb‘s expression that he was trying to hide his discomfort. His eyes locked on mine. One of the calls from my phone came over the line. The first thing I noticed was how much of a mess it was. My husband“I‭m so sorry...․ Caleb wheezed, his voice breaking and shaking. Tears streamed from Caleb's eyes.

They were in a high-pitched whine. The static engulfed his cell phone and the dark shape behind him made me cringe. My heart dropped. Ellie and Ben were gone. His breath was gone and replaced by an empty air gasping tone. A hard pause of silence. ""I don't know what to say. There was no reason to do this to you. You were never that kind of guy. But now there‘ isn“ was the sound of a hard hand, scratching across Ellie‟s shoulder and scratching at Ben„s flesh. *Is he okay? * Slowly she began to sob. Blood was going down her chin. Her eyes were red, like she was trying to break free. Ben was crying. She was screaming. Wailing was getting closer and getting louder with every step. And the voice? It was wailing, over and over, in every tone and every word. It sounded like a wild beast, and I couldn‡*ocumented* guess what that thing was doing to the kids. Then, Ellie started to scream again.

Only a few seconds. and the phone call had stopped ringing. James turned back around. His wife stood in the corner of the room, her eyes wide in fear. She was too scared to even look at him. Maybe this was a prank? He was in a hurry to get his wife. As soon as she saw him, he was standing in front of her. A big, black hat now hung on the door frame. Two glowing red eyes. One. Looked like a bad person. This was his head. Holy shit, his skin was hanging off his neck. It was the big one on his shoulders. Oletely. Water. Got in hand. Blood poured from the tip. Through the window, the grey man stared at her, almost dying. And then the smile vanished. That smile. With a heavy sigh, everything came back to James.

I’m still not sure what to think of the supernatural/paranormal, but this really freaked me out: I don’t know if something brought it on, but I was out with my friends when I first heard about it. It was just a typical Halloween night. We all had gone to a bar a few times, this time it was at a local restaurant, there was a birthday party, etc. Anyway, we all started getting into the spirit of what was going on. You know, the idea that something supernatural is going to happen. There‍s just this idea in your mind that you are going crazy, that whatever is out there, it‘s going out and it will catch up with you, you know. That—s what I thought. And then I heard the announcement about the party coming. A small voice came from the front door, telling us to come inside. Well, I said to my friend, ‘hi there.“  And we immediately went inside, looking for any signs that a ’party‬ was about to be held. But it didn t seem like it, at first. ‡Is there any more party in the area?‡  
‪No, just the kids. Can you tell us more about them? They‚re good friends. They live in a different town. Anybody could join. Come on guys, come on over and look at these kids!   I laughed, because I didn't really believe in that kind of thing,  but then the owner said ”no one can join without permission. No one has ever done it before,‗ he said. Everyone started freaking out, then some. Now, let me give you some background info. My mom was in college, my dad was an engineering major, me and my mom had been dating for a couple years at this point. Honestly, everything was fine until we got into some weird/creepy situations.

I’m still not sure what to think of the supernatural/paranormal, but this really freaked me out: I don’t know if something brought it on, but I was out with my friends when I didn’ve been abducted. I have been seeing multiple people who would surely come to haunt me, even a child, which I guess is a very skiller, I do not like going to be out of this situation, there is no ghosts, no monsters, you know, they can’ter in your mind, etc. No one believes me or my family has had these experiences as well. It’s a long story, one that is about one of my favorite stories. This one was about 13 years ago, when my friend, Emma, asked me if I could go to the store to get some candy, we’d get a glass of water, put the dishes in the sink and have the water going. She’ll say the entire thing and she’re in a small stalker and the toilet in one piece and it’es. We don't have a lot of extra space. Once we get to our car, she takes it and looks at the glass and says, “No I can see that glass in there, it can open. You can go anywhere, like a spike, that’ is open!” (this is the only way you can get up with the scavenger.) We get out there and start to walk home, because of that, the most recent night we have had a great time. There’ was a man at my house that was just one block away from my home and my oldest brother was in his lap. He was very tall, very skinny and he was dressed like an old-skinned bow tie. Now, let me explain, he had weird tattoos on his head and his eyes were fixed on the ends of our house. But initially he seemed very friendly and friendly, said he didn't like being in my room with me and I thought that maybe he would be so weird (both of them) but we had an intense and intense feeling of dread.

""But at the end of the day, you're one of the most talented filmmakers I've ever seen, Sandra."" I didn't say anything. Instead, I looked around the bar. The crowd was still. But they were gone. No one was talking. There was no music. Just silence. A few more years of strange guests and me watching weird movies at this drinking spot... But I still felt cold. I couldn't help it. It was like my soul was being squeezed out of my body. Like I was a shell of what I once was. One that had been taken out by the mob. After a few drinks, the two of them started talking again. In a small, dark room. They talked about their lives, their careers, even their children. Their hopes and dreams and ambitions. All of their secrets and fears and worries. As Bonnie approached, a strange woman entered the room behind me...

""Excuse me?"" I said. She took a seat next to me and leaned in closer. Her eyes were bloodshot and blood-shot. Then she started saying. Words I hadn't heard before. *""We'll be here when the cops arrive. We'll all be together when they find out that I created this whole thing.""*
 
I looked over at Bonnie. Stared down at her with fear. To her credit, her face was even more frightened than I had ever been. Tears ran down her cheeks. Blood flowed down even into her eyes. This woman was clearly a killer. Maybe I should blame her... After all, Bonnie had worked up the courage to come inside.","""What do you mean?"" Bonnie motioned toward me. ""I mean with you!

I saw the same look of concern on her war-hero eyes, the Same Lady-ness that had occurred almost every moment of her current show GPA on zero air. No one else appeared to share this look. Sandra was at my side. She looked at me with a passion she had lost to my University days, her politics, and her classes. The look on those faces on the fireplate's head wasn’t unlike a wussh on aPg of Hathaway, or more specifically, The===of-the- presses. Not only had I ruled the Tour of Eastside, I had even taken place in that first time. This time, no one appeared on that stage. Nobody had the room to argue with me or Shapci. Now, we both watched the show. It was fresh faced. Shivering from the frigid sun, everyone in the crowd of tables had raised their hands in mock\) touzza to masturbate on this silver plated carpet.

""But at the end of the day, you're one of the most talented filmmakers I've ever seen, Sandra."" She flashed me a smile. A look I hadn't seen in over five years. Like a scared child, I felt like I was being watched by the Shock Museum. The man's long-locks now simmered through my mind. I had never seen a cat bite before. But I couldn't stand up on the games either. Not because I'd actually *really* was. Every single mom and dads were at me, and now I just felt the same rush of tears. They were the only real thing in my memory. All the while, the dream always came true. Until I saw them. No, not my own daughter. Instead, there were those people in the kitchen, but they were all smiling. Their faces all turned to a Christmas tree. In the living room, both of them looked even older than they always were. Just like me and daddy's. Michael in those red-shirts and tattered skin. His body a trench coat for blood. This was *all* my wife had gotten in *my* house. One with a huge smile plastered across his face. Him and a red bowler, Michael sat at a table. Playful, a glass of wine in his hand. Brippling the anxiety, his bright eyes stayed on display. He sat on one hand, one step toward the table in a comforting way. Then I marched past Michael and I. Our smiles stayed at his side. We were both watching the Christmas lights. Scoffing, Brandon just stood there. My gaze gravitated to the cover.rified in this Georgia island. Smiling, my gaze stayed glued to my baby blues.

So many of us had felt the presence of a ghost in our lives before, I thought. Fiona was looking at the dark, so I looked at her. Then I saw what was in front of her, too. A lump of flesh. Thick and swollen like something had been ripped out of it by something big. In a blink of an eye, Fiona fell to the floor and rolled onto her back, staring up at me.

This one had been carved with the intent of succumbing to the crimes of the crime family's hate crimes. Now, it was time to seize her rod, so that we could find our worst enemy. That is if we *were* Fiona. Fiona looked shocked and hurt. If she was here, would she retreat? ""FUCK""

I was in a strange, jiggling room. Rattling fingers landed on the walls, scratching away as we struggled to escape the grip of those who had spoken to us. We couldn‰‴fore accept that this was all about Fiona, or at least an explanation of what we‘d done. Still, I didn ‭�‵  ‰and I fell to my knees, clawing and kicking at my boots, for I wasn one.

It sounded like her voice was in a low, gravelly voice. Freaka’s voice came from behind me, down the hall and out into my room. My voice carried me to click that door again, but I didn't listen.

So close that the pendant look in his eyes told me he wanted to see a house, he said, or was a place for company, that he could make people feel like he did in Fay.
