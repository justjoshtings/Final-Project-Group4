"""Damn! Ten thirty-five!"" Amused, I watched Bonnie put her glass down and snatch a remote control. Faster than fourteen-year-old Sandra on those late Friday nights... ""I'm missing *Raven's Home*!"" Bonnie said. One frantic hit turned on the flatscreen. ""Raven's what?"" I asked. ""Like the Disney channel?"" Clutching the remote, Bonnie confronted me. ""Yes! It's a new episode!""","""Damn! Ten thirty-five!"" Amused, I watched Bonnie put her glass down and snatch a remote control. Faster than fourteen-year-old Sandra on those late Friday nights...

It's a new episode!"" ""Yeah, it's new!"" she said with a laugh. I took a deep breath. And a thumbs up. This was *my* popular channel. Bonnie and Clyde were the first ones I ever watched. The new episodes were always better than the originals... or even worse, the episodes themselves were *dirtier*. A greasy, dingy, and mean show complete with bad grammatical errors and grammatically incorrect sentences. But the Bonnie charm never felt *true*. The episode titles were all over the place. No surprise. A *weird* title. For all the nostalgia, there was just a bit of humanness to these episodes. Just the human warmth not backed up by gross stereotypes or negative stereotypes...

""No!"" I yelled. With a smirk, she pointed toward the end of the episode. Toward the grave. Right toward where I now saw the camera peering back at me from the attic. Even from here. Am I really this scared to death? I looked over at the T.V. and Bonnie was standing by the window. She still didn't look bored. Still didn’t stop staring at that creepy looking guy in the Halloween costume. Behind the sunglasses and sunglasses, we both stayed silent. Both of us now a part of this creepy show. Staying silent forever. Frightened, me and the kids looked at each other. We looked into each others' eyes... even when we looked right back. Like a scared child, my nervous frame took another hit. All of my confidence and joy vanished.","""Damn! Ten thirty-five!"" Amused, I watched Bonnie put her glass down and snatch a remote control.

It's a new episode!"" ""Surprise!"" Ruth yelled. In a split second, the CDC was gone. The three of us now stood right before the scarecrow. Warm nothing but darkness. All of the sudden, both cars surrounded us. I could see a wide receiver of unease in my mind. Their eyes wide with shock. Even from here, all of them were on their way. As did the uneases, my focus was focussed on me once more. A growing fear began to fade. From the pit of my stomach, a migraine pierced through my veins. At first, it seemed that I was the only one on our list. But I couldn't help but laugh at the moment. It was beyond freezing. Especially when I heard my mother's voice... the more I thought she was. More fear than a cattleture, fearsome in her voice. Like a man, she'd gotten the better of me and gone back to the cabin. She'd come back, revealing a smiley face. Her skin was so shiny, her eyes were sunken in, their bodily irate lust. Much like the rest of her family had left this ocean of love. And now, most of all, many years later, Rob and I had all been in the same room with her. We played a few LCD's icing FDs in a VHS machine. Personally, we had a BD player in all his years. Ms. Florence had been a writer who'd been at Stanwyck's house several years ago. Now, even the commercial Sevenue was in good shape. Together, they watched us as a group of animations descended into the room. An animatronic was impersonal. Or at least, that was *my* game...

""What do you mean?"" Nannocking, Terry grabbed my arm. For a moment",0,0,0
