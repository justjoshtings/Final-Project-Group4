"We ran into her office and locked the door and waited about 5-10 minutes while she held her ear to the door to make sure she didn’t hear anything. As I’m writing this I’m almost laughing like a lunatic because at this point we sound like paranoid freaks as really NOTHING had happened but I’m so glad we watch way too many horror movies. We then unlocked the door and quickly looked out, then ran to the stairwell and ran the fuck out of her office, got in the car and drove home. That was the end of the story for me at the time.

I asked my mom when I was a teenager if she remembered that weird time at her office when we hid in her office and ran away from a guy in the elevator and her face turned white, she said she “knew it was just us” and just went back to doing her thing. She told me this was in 1997, the year the movie ‘The Shining‘ was released and I remember her sitting there and she asked if anyone was there. The elevator stopped at 1:11am on a Thursday and we got back on the road. It was about 2 hours from here and the guy who was on that elevator was looking at us through the glass door when he saw us. He saw what we did and he ran down to us and told us to get back in his car. My mom was still dumbfounded. Her office was next to ours and it had never looked this way before. So she told my dad and asked us if we had any friends in high places and if they had ever seen us before and they were scared to go to that office. They all agreed but told our mom to stay in their cars until we were sure we weren t „walking off the rails“. (It was probably around 1am)

My dad drove us out to our place and my moms car was already in our driveway. For the next 3 years I had to drive around the town from my house to my work and sometimes I would get to see my old friends. One day I got home from work, my husband was at work (he works at a retail store) and was hanging out with his friends who were all hanging around our house. At first I thought they would leave me alone and leave but they weren't there anymore. When I walked in my door there was no one there so I assumed they went to a different place.

I asked my mom when I was a teenager if she remembered that weird time at her office when we hid in her office and ran away from a guy in the elevator and her face turned white, and she just said “ I don” 

So I started making plans to go meet up with her at my office. It was already getting dark out so we decided to meet at another one of my other work locations to hang out and do some work. Just in case there‘s a friend or family that live outside of our area who wants to hurt us, she called us all over the county and told us to kill all the employees to get away. She said we could hunt and kill any employee we found, we were a little strict and said let“t her my ‘cause she—s got some shit on. OK so now this person on the other end is like your friend‛️. And I know you‖ve got nothing on him because I knew youriuses were tracking employee tracker and so I gave him the benefit of doubt.

I asked my mom when I was a teenager if she remembered that weird time at her office when we hid in her office and ran away from a guy in the elevator and her face turned white, like you had no idea who she was. This was just the weirdo to me and my friends were just so freaked out and blaming at my girlfriend’s table so I figured it might be a prank. She was in tears and said she had a weird gut feeling about this. After that, she left and I went to get the keys out. At this time we had to check the bathroom and she’d left in there a couple minutes. So we have the code and a flashlight and one of my brothers had flashlight on the lift. My mom always had one light on so she could use them. One day I got home and decided to take my jacket and take a shower to put it on my dresser. The light was on and it was really dark out there. There were a few flashlights in this area so the flashlight could be anywhere in that room and the light went out so my parents would have to go to bed. Not to mention I had an issue with this guy and an inmate who was not with the shotgun on top of me. He had the creeps that would show me over to my room. It was about 10 feet long and about halfway down the drain we got to our door open. Now it wasn’ification- it looked like the guy had dropped it and he was pissed on it. Finally, we were all walking back to your room when the lights came on. When we went back, the only light source was that illuminated the room light switch. In the reflection of this man, I could see him. His face was pale and his eyes were completely black, his mouth was completely red like he had just crawled back and fell backwards. Both of us were crying",0,0,0
